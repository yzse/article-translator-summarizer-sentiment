  |12-29-2022|Rusia lanza uno de los mayores ataques de la guerra contra las infraestructuras energéticas de Ucrania||A missile rain on New Year's Eve leaves 90 percent of the homes in the city of Lviv and 40 percent of the homes in Kiev out of light On the eve of the celebrations to receive the new year, Russia has launched a missile rain on Ukraine this Thursday. The sound of the explosions has resounded since shortly after dawn in towns and cities throughout the country. The attack, with 69 cruise missiles and drone bombs, according to the Kiev Government, is one of the largest in the Kremlin war in Ukraine, and has been directed primarily against the country's energy infrastructure. Since temperatures began to fall, Russia has made great efforts to attack power plants. “It has been the tenth bombing of strategic facilities since September. Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to plunge Ukraine into darkness and cold to break the resistance of a population that endures a war that has entered its eleventh month. When the first rays of sun began to rise in Kiev, the buzz of the missiles and a gray trail have crossed the sky. The anti-aircraft alarms had alerted almost an hour before the capital, like the entire country, was on missile attack alert. Moscow has fired this Thursday 16 over the Ukrainian capital. All have been intercepted by air defences, according to the authorities. However, remains of projectiles have impacted two houses, a playground and a factory and injured three people, including a 14-year-old teenager, according to the mayor's office. Ukrainian air defences have intercepted 54 of the 69 missiles the Kremlin has fired on Ukraine. The attacks this Thursday, however, have reached one of the energy infrastructures of the city of Jerson, northeastern Ukraine, and have killed one person and wounded another. The rain of bombings has left more than 90% of Lviv without light, according to the city's mayorship in the west of the country, which has also warned of severe water cuts. In Kiev, 40 per cent of households have been left in the dark, according to their mayor, Vitali Klitschko, who recommended that the population supply water and keep mobile phones and other devices with batteries charged, waiting for what might come. In the city of Odessa, on the Black Sea, where yesterday the local authorities removed a statue of the Russian Empress Catherine the Great, as another of the steps towards the “desrusification” and “de-imperialistization” of the country, important blackouts have also been recorded. In the port city, considered the pearl of the Black Sea and long awaited by Russian imperialism, the air defenses intercepted 21 missiles, according to the authorities. Several buildings, an electric line and a gas pipeline have been damaged in a bombing outside the city of Zaporiyia, in the south-central part of the country, according to the governor, Oleksandr Staruj. In Jersón (south), recovered by Ukraine in November after months of Russian occupation, a missile hit a medical facility, according to local authorities. There are two wounded. “They dream that Ukrainians will celebrate the New Year in the dark and cold. But they cannot defeat the Ukrainian people,” said the Ministry of Defense on social media. Russia, which in recent days has scorned Ukraine's proposal for dialogue, based on a decalogue establishing the withdrawal of Russian troops, the restoration of the country's territorial sovereignty, the return of prisoners or the payment of reparations, scoffed at the attacks early in the morning. Without further comment, the Russian Ministry of Defence published on its Telegram channel a photograph of the launch of a missile and the phrase: “The Kalibrs will never stop”, referring to the Kalibr missiles used by Russian forces. Kremlin troops have launched the large-scale attack on Ukraine from at least two ships and 13 strategic bombers, from which they have fired cruise missiles, according to the leadership of the Ukrainian Air Force. Shortly before the rain of projectiles, Moscow sent swarms of drone bombs, mostly aircraft manufactured in Iran, with which Russia sought to distract anti-aircraft defenses before discharging the rain from missiles. This Thursday, the buzz of a swarm of at least 13 Iranian drones Shahed-136 has flooded the skies of the city of Jarkov; 11 of them have been shot down, according to the authorities. In Dnipró, in the centre of the country, a strategic city, a communications hub and a major logistics hub, anti-aircraft defences have shot down five drones, followed by a series of missiles. The southern command of Ukraine has alerted that three Russian naval ships are in combat position in the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski had warned a few days ago that Russia was preparing another large-scale bombing during the festivities. “With the arrival of the Christmas season, Russian terrorists can be active again,” he said a few days ago. “They despise Christian values and any value in general,” he added.This Thursday’s massive bombings arrive a few days after a drone reached a Russian strategic air base, from which Moscow has launched bombings against Ukraine’s vital infrastructure, in an attack that killed at least three Kremlin soldiers and has exposed new cracks in Russian air defences and in the design of the invasion. This attack was the second to be carried out with a drone against the same Engels base in the Saratov region. As in previous incursions, the Ukrainian government maintains cryptic language about the drone attack: it is not directly attributed to it, but it has been pointed out to have been a consequence of the Kremlin war. This Thursday, Saratov's governor, Roman Busargin, claimed that Russian air defences tore down another drone on Thursday near the city of Engels, which caused damage to a car and garage but did not cause injury.
