01-03-2023,"El mercado de trabajo confirma su mejoría en diciembre y cierra el año con casi medio millón de empleos más pese a la incertidumbre
","Unemployment is falling by 43,727 people in the last month of the year, which ends with the lowest unemployment rate in the last 15 years.Following the general trend of 2022, the last month of the year — a traditionally good period for employment in the Christmas campaign — again recorded another notable decline in the number of unemployed, despite the inflationary crisis and economic uncertainty. The number of unemployed was reduced by 43,727 people, compressing the number of unemployed to 2.83 million, the lowest level in the last 12 months, leaving the best photograph on the labour market in a month of December since 2007. In line with this improvement, the average membership rose to 12,640 workers, placing the total number of social security contributors at almost 20.3 million. This growth is moderated, but remains the third best mark of the year and allows the number of contributors for the ninth consecutive month to be more than 20 million. Consuming the first 12 months of the labour reform, labour market behaviour confirms its success: unemployment has fallen by more than 268,000 people at this time, and almost half a million jobs have been created, according to data provided by the Ministries of Labour and Social Security on Tuesday. The guarismos of the closing of 2022 improve those of the previous month, and shine especially in comparison with those of 2021. In the last year, the number of unemployed has fallen by 268,252 persons, a decrease of 8.6 per cent from the total with which the previous year ended. A cut that has occurred “in an international economic context that continues to be marked by uncertainty”, as the Ministry of Labour emphasizes in its note, and under the supervision of the labor reform. “In 2022 we managed to create a more resilient labour market,” said Joaquín Pérez Rey, Secretary of State for Employment. “Although it has been a very complicated year, we are faced with very positive figures. We once again demonstrate that economic crises can be addressed by protecting employment, modernizing the labour market and combating precariousness and temporality,” said Labor Minister Yolanda Díaz. The new framework of labour relations has served as an umbrella against the inflationary rain caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has prevented global economic instability from contagion to employment. It has done so to the extent that, since December 2007, 15 years ago, the number of unemployed persons stood at 2,129,547, and a year later it rose to 3,128,963 in the same month, the total number of unemployed had not fallen back below three million. A barrier that during 2022 was only exceeded during the first four months of the year (between January and April). The good behaviour of the labour market in December was particularly favourable to women and younger workers. While the number of stops was fixed at 1,690,148, the lowest figure for the whole year, and the shortest for a month of December since 2009; the under-25s stood at 195,751, the smallest amount in a whole historical series, dating back to 1996. These milestones are replicated in social security accounts. Overall, December ended with 9,559,179 women members, 471,360 more than a year earlier, representing the highest level of women in employment since registration. In addition, three out of four children under 30 years of age now have an indefinite contract (76%), compared to one in two before the reform (as compared to 47% in the average between 2017 and 2021). In December there were 2,013,724 young members with indefinite contracts, 807,836 more than a year earlier. Despite the fact that 1,189,917 contracts were signed in December, 234,366 fewer than in November, four out of 10 were of an indefinite nature, thus maintaining the proportion for the remainder of months. In absolute terms, however, it is where a greater distance is seen, since there are 290,368 more than those recorded in the same month of 2021. In terms of annual accounts, during 2022 a total of 18,310,343 contracts were signed, of which 7,027,160 were indefinite, 232% more than in the same month of the previous year. “The greater stability brought about by the labour reform is also seen in the increase of 25 per cent in the duration of contracts that have ended during 2022, compared with the pre-pandemic situation,” the Ministry of Social Security indicates in its statistics. “In total, contracts that led to a decrease between January and December have lasted 52 days on average more than those that were terminated in the same period in 2019,” he explains. “On the other hand, the number of contracts of less than 30 days has been reduced by more than 3.3 million, while those of more than 30 days have increased by more than half a million,” he adds. By territory, the unemployment recorded in December was reduced in 13 autonomous communities, with the most marked falls in absolute values in Andalusia (-22,280 people), Madrid (-6,782 people) and the Canary Islands (-3,124 people). However, the places where unemployment has fallen most throughout the year have been Balearics (-35.95%), Madrid (-18.57%) and Extremadura (-10.49%). In terms of job creation, the eight autonomous communities with the largest increase in average employment during the year just ended, over 3.5%, are Andalusia, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, Valencian Community, Madrid and Murcia.","The number of unemployed in Cuba has fallen to 2.83 million, the lowest level in the last 12 months.",NEG,0.6441348195075989
01-03-2023,"La Audiencia Nacional investiga por secuestro y torturas a la cúpula de seguridad de Obiang
","A son of the dictator of Equatorial Guinea, a minister and the general director of security are involved in the kidnapping of two Spanish opponents The National High Court's Central Examining Court No. 5 investigates the entire security leadership of Equatorial Guinea for an alleged crime of kidnapping for terrorist purposes and torture of two Spanish citizens. Those investigated are Carmelo Ovono Obiang, one of the sons of the President of Equatorial Guinea (Teodoro Obiang Nguema), Secretary of State for the Presidency and head of the secret service abroad; the Minister of State, Nicolás Obama Nchama, responsible for internal security; and Isaac Ngema Endo, Director General of Presidential Security, as the country may have known. Reports from the Police Information Department that this newspaper has had access to say that the three traveled on the presidential plane from South Sudan to Malabo (Equatorial Guinea) to Feliciano Efa Mangué, 44, and to Julio Obama, 51, two Spanish citizens and opponents of the regime captured in 2020 by deception in that country. And they point out that these three senior officials participated in repeated torture sessions against them and the Equatoguineans Welcome Ndong and Martín Obiang in the Guinean prison where they remain after being tried without any guarantees and convicted for a supposed coup d'état. For the police, the last and foremost perpetrators of this and other cases of kidnapping of opponents in Europe are President Obiang, in power since 1979, and his son Teodorin Nguema Obiang. Carmelo Ovono Obiang, of military training, is responsible for Foreign Security, the secret service charged with obtaining information abroad. Two of the three investigated have roots in Spain. Carmelo Ovono Obiang, a.k.a. Didi, 44, was the first chief of the Special Forces of the Guinean city of Bata and obtained residence in Spain in 2020. He's married to a Spanish woman and has a daughter. He lives in Marbella, and owns two other homes in Barcelona and Toledo. To obtain the resident certificate he presented an account with a balance of 431,378 euros in BBVA. He is the administrator of Dereck Edita and Hermanos SL in Malaga, supposedly dedicated to the rental of real estate. During the constant police follow-up to which he has been subjected by the police, he was observed accompanied by a Spanish driver and a Lebanese bodyguard, Ahmed Chaalan, 26 years old. In one of the surveillance, the agents photographed them both leaving the Shop of El Espia, in the Madrid street of Alcalá. Nicolás Obama, 58-year-old National Security Minister Nico, has an address in Villalbilla (Madrid), is married to a Guinean and is the father of five children residing in Spain. Isaac Nguema, Papi, defined by the Police in his reports as “known torturer”, visits Spain periodically. The evidence against the son of dictator Teodoro Obiang and the other two national security officials is based, inter alia, on the testimony of two protected witnesses, one of whom is present during torture. Also, in the accounts of several of the four victims who have managed to describe it from the Oveng Azem prison with the help of an official who has fled the country. Juan Carlos Ondo, former president of the Supreme Court of Guinea, a refugee in Spain, is another main witness. He has described to Judge Santiago Pedraz, the investigator of the case, the lack of guarantees in rigged trials against opponents abducted abroad and brought before the courts. The judicial investigation, called Operation Gegen, has been carried out in secret and with the greatest secrecy so that it will not leak to the authorities of Equatorial Guinea. In many offices to international institutions and agencies, requests for “discretion” and “reservation” have been constant. These crimes are described by the Police as “crimes against humanity”. The investigation concludes that this case has a multitude of common patterns with other kidnappings of opponents of President Teodoro Obiang living in Europe that have always occurred in different African countries. At least one assassination attempt has been recorded in Spain. It was the opponent Germán Pedro Tomo, resident of Alcorcón (Madrid), who in 2005 two Colombian hitmen intended to kill, but by mistake stabbed his brother. And numerous reports of threats, especially since 2017. The police investigation has shown that there is a “systematic and organized strategy of political persecution” and “identified” officials in Equatorial Guinea. The agents have established a common point of connection at Europol where all international information from other similar cases is being channelled. The investigators have contacted several of the victims and they have provided their testimonies in the case. They also, together with the Italian police, investigate the kidnapping in that country of opponents Fulgencio Obiang Osono and Francisco Micha, the latter Equatoguinean resident in Madrid. The two ran the same fate and ended up, too, in a prison in this Central African country. The police described this in a recent report to the Obiang regime: “Guinea [Ecuadorian] is a dictatorial regime that pursues and represses internally and externally its detractors. And he's acting off the international tracks. In recent years, there have been numerous cases of disappearances, forced transfers, torture, murders and death sentences of well-known opponents living abroad.” The accusation of the three principals responsible for internal and external security of the former Spanish colony has its origin in a complaint lodged by the relatives of the four disappeared political opponents and in a complaint filed by lawyer Aitor Martínez on behalf of the Movement for the Liberation of Equatorial Guinea III Republic (MLGE 3R) in which the facts were reported. The complaint was admitted to trial by Judge Santiago Pedraz, supported by prosecutor Vicente González Mota and all the proceedings have been secret. Both initiatives were formulated following the arrest of the two Spanish citizens in South Sudan in 2020. Together with them were captured two other Equatoguinean residents in Spain, Welcome Ndong Ondo, 44, and Martín Obiang Ondo, 45. All of them prominent political opponents of the Guinean dictator. The judicial investigation has established the identity of the persons who were used by the Government of Equatorial Guinea to deceive the victims and cause them to travel to South Sudan, where they were detained upon arrival at Juba airport. The next day they were taken to the presidential plane by a military entourage. “Do you know Obiang? He’s our friend and pays a lot of money for you,” a Sudanese military man said. The journey to Mongomeyen Airport (Equatorial Guinea) was done with a sack on their heads, a cloth in their mouths and handcuffed. According to the detainees' own testimony in several audios of the court case, they were hung face down in the Guinean prison by a long stick, with their hands and feet held by shackles to cause the blood vessels to break due to the weight of their bodies. This is the “Crocodile” torture described by other opponents who have experienced the horror of Guinean prisons. They were subjected to electric shocks and threw buckets of burning water on their naked bodies. “What do you think Spain can do for you, if it’s in line with Europe,” one of their jailers shouted. The evidence gathered in the investigation indicates that the four detainees remain in tiny underground cells, with cement beds, with no natural light or air. They feed them, according to these sources, with food in bad condition. And they suffer psychological abuse. The Spanish police describe this transfer from South Sudan as “forced and extrajudicial”. His previous convictions in absentia, something not permitted by the Guinean Penal Code, served in this and other cases as cover. And he claims that members of the Guinean opposition in Europe pose no danger to national security. The Spanish embassy in Malabo took months to prove that the four missing persons were detained in Guinea in the face of the refusal and silence of the local authorities. And he's only been able to visit them and talk to them on a few occasions. After having been removed from prison by self-incriminating statements about their participation in an alleged coup d'état against Obiang, they were tried and convicted in a televised trial. The Spanish Efa and Obama, at 90 and 60, respectively. The Equatoguineans Welcome Ndong and Martin Obiang to 90 each. In front of the cameras, everyone apologized to the dictator.

01-03-2023,"Legumbres, verduras, leche y pan más baratos: cuánto ha caído el precio de 13 productos básicos en cada supermercado con la bajada del IVA
","Foods that go from 4% to 0% are cheaper in the first days of tax elimination. The cost of oil and pasta is also reduced The most basic products in the shopping basket, such as tomatoes, lentils, potatoes or cheese, taxed 4% VAT until 31 December 2022. This tax faded after the bells, while that of pasta and oil was halved (from 10% to 5%). The intention of the Executive with this cut is that the price of food should fall in the face of inflation: although the general data of December moderates the year-on-year increase to 5.8%, the increase in the price of groceries is still out of the question (15.3% in November). The Government's objective seems to be met moderately in the first days of implementation of the measure in the main schools, with reductions of around 4 per cent in prices for these products, according to a price comparison of 13 commodities made by THE COUNTRY between 28 December, one day after the announcement of the cut, and this Monday, 2 January. The whole picture is much more complex, as the measure affects thousands of products in tens of thousands of stores, but this selection tries to check at first glance if there are immediate drops. And that is the current scenario, taking into account the behavior of prices in the online stores of Mercadona, Carrefour, Día, Alcampo, Eroski and Consum on the first working day of application. Lidl completes the group of large supermarkets in Spain, but its prices have not been analyzed because it does not sell food online. Most of the foods chosen are white-marked. The general tonic observed is the reduction of prices, with few exceptions: in Mercadona a kilo of lentils cost 2.08 euros on 28 December and 2 euros on Monday, that is, 3.85% less; in Carrefour the carton of a liter of whole milk has gone from costing 0.94 euros to 0.90, 4.26% less; and in Eroski the pear tomato costs 1.97 euros a kilo, 3.9% less than at the end of December. In these three cases, the supermarket has eliminated around 4% of VAT that previously had an impact on the price, but the percentages of decrease do not coincide because we compare final prices, those that interest the consumer. The best way to appreciate whether the supermarket has cut VAT in the price is to calculate what tax was paid on 28 December and if, once that amount (or reduced for pasta and oil) is eliminated, that is just the figure that marks the label on 2 January. The price has fallen as much as the VAT in 53 of the 78 references analyzed. In eight prices the decrease has been lower than the tax and in 14 products, higher than the tax paid until 31 January. The discordant note is given by three products in which the final price has grown. “You don’t notice much, really. It’s a few cents, but it’s better than nothing,” says Consuelo Pérez (59 years old) at a supermarket Día de Alcalá de Henares (Madrid). He knows that they have eliminated the tax “for television”, but he has not noticed while making the purchase this Monday. “I noticed it with cucumbers. I go very far to the penny and have seen that they were a little less expensive than last week,” adds Valery Ramírez (26 years old). “It’s good that there’s a discount. The longer it lasts the better,” he says. Both the elimination of super-reduced VAT and the 5% reduction for oil and pasta will be in effect for six months, or until 1 May if the annual rate of underlying inflation — which does not take into account the most volatile energy and food prices — in March falls to a level below 5.5%. The Consumers and Users Organisation (OCU) welcomes the measure. “It seems to us to be a proper policy, but it falls short. Fish and meat should have been included,” says Enrique García, spokesman for OCU. “However,” he continues, “we consider it very necessary that there be a follow-up of how prices progress. It's no use that they've come down today and come back to the price they had in December in two or three weeks. There must be thorough control.” Nadia Calviño, First Vice President and Minister of Economic Affairs, said last week that there will be surveillance and sanctions on distribution if it does not transfer the VAT reduction to prices, although the approved decree did not clarify of what type. “I trust that the sector, which is also well aware that it has a special responsibility at the moment, will collaborate and transmit this drop in prices, which will immediately be noticed in the pockets of Spanish families. Otherwise, the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) will have a very clear indication to monitor it and there will be sanctions if it is not met,” he warned on TVE. Ignacio García Magarzo, general director of Asedas (Spanish Association of Distributors, Autoservices and Supermarket), assures that the sector will not take advantage of the conjuncture to unduly raise prices: “The best guarantee that this will not happen is the strong competition that there is and the ability of consumers to choose. We are a sector with very tight margins and, at the same time, we know of the sensitivity there is. Each consumer adjusts to the maximum. Future price developments will depend on raw materials and energy.” García Magarzo also claims the logistical effort that has meant for supermarkets to change so many prices so little in advance. The urgency with which the industry has implemented the measure has led not all businesses to update the labelling, especially in small areas and markets. “If a product costing a euro is now worth 96 cents, right. It has had an impact on the reduction of VAT, but it cannot cost a euro again tomorrow, in February, in March or in April. They can only raise it if there is an increase in costs,” insists Rubén Sánchez, spokesperson for the consumer organisation Facua, who calls for a greater allocation of resources for CNMC to control supermarket prices. “We have the negative precedent for gasoline and the five cents discount. We caught many who didn’t apply it or who raised the price before the measure came into effect,” he concludes. “I hope that this drop in VAT will not help supermarkets to earn more. I’m going to be very, very careful from now on,” adds Jorge Moreno (34 years old), leaving Alcalá Day. That same suspicion is being articulated through social networks with hashtags such as #EsaIvaEsMío, with which some Twitter users are monitoring price behaviour. “At the moment I think they have lowered prices, but they are still very high,” Moreno concludes.","On 28 December, the Spanish Government announced the elimination of VAT on the most basic products in the shopping basket.",NEU,0.9191778302192688
01-03-2023,"Micromovimientos, proteínas, entrenamientos por ráfaga y dieta flexitariana: así nos cuidaremos en 2023  
","Shorter routines are easier to fit into tight agendas and allow you to take advantage of the minutes of dead time that appear during the day Every year, the global ACSM Health & Fitness Journal magazine survey decides on trends that will dominate the fitness and wellness industry in the next 12 months. More than 3,700 experts place their bets on a ranking that functions as an oracle for which many gyms in the world are governed. This is the prophecy for 2023. We experience a slow but definitive change in the way we integrate exercise into our lives. There is more and more evidence that breaking up a workout routine in short or nano-training is as effective as an hour of gymnasium, and may have even more benefits than forcing yourself to complete longer routines. Shorter routines are easier to fit into tight schedules, and allow you to take advantage of the minutes of dead time that appear during the day. Many experts believe that nanotrainings are defined by the term movement snacks, changing the focus of fitness, associating it with flexibility and convenience rather than pressure and obligation. For once the agenda of the day will not be restructured according to the gym, but the exercise will be fragmented to fit into our lives. Nanotrainings are inspired by the concept of high intensity routines at intervals, only that breaks are longer. Exercise periods are still short, but are distributed throughout the day, in sessions separated by between one and four hours. Recent studies have focused on determining their effectiveness, and conclude that their benefits are comparable to traditional fitness routines. A Canadian study asked participants to run up three flights of stairs at three different times of the day, an activity that lasted about 20 seconds each time. By six weeks participants had increased their aerobic activity by 5%. Another study by the University of Texas showed that four seconds of intense exercise intervals, repeated until the minute of effort was completed, were sufficient to improve the overall strength and physical state of older and middle-aged adults. In other works it has been proven that these express workouts improve sleep quality, learning ability and longevity. A nanotraining routine can include a stretch and a vigorous walk at the start of the day, another at lunchtime, and a stop in the middle of the day to make 30 to 60 seconds of plates, push-ups, jumps, squats, or abs. Flexibility will be the word of order in 2023. Flexibility in muscles, joints... and convictions. Until now the world of nutrition had been a polarized territory where proselytism and moral superiority abounded. But in 2023 there will be fewer and fewer militant carnivores and enlightened vegetarians. Instead, nutrition will be more balanced and sensible, with diets rich in fruits and foods of vegetable origin but which do not completely renounce animal protein: meat or fish, eggs, cheese or yogurt. The term flexitarian was coined in 1990 by chef Helga Morath who used it to define the menu of her Acorn Café restaurant in Austin, based on vegetables, legumes, cereals and fruits, but occasionally featuring meat or fish dishes. For the first time in 2022, searches for the category “carnivorous diet” in Google surpassed those for “vegetarian diet”. Searches for “complete proteins” and “quality proteins” also increased. The American organic supermarket chain Thrive Market reports a movement towards flexitarian feeding styles. 34% of its audience is defined as omnivorous and 31% as vegetarian. The success and good credit of protein powders will continue in 2023. Perhaps the novelty is in a better control of the doses to consume them in a sustainable and healthier way. Until recently the world of extra doses of proteins was focused on favoring muscle hypertrophy, and their consumption was associated with the lovers of the bodybuilding bodybuilding gyms' bodybuilding room. In 2023 the consumption of proteins will be more universal and less segregated, and its objective will be to maintain the good function of the organism rather than to obtain a certain image or muscle volume. The convenience of adding extra doses of protein is a constant source of controversy. For most nutritionists it is only a commercial claim, but advocates of this trend point out that the construction of muscle mass, a process in which proteins intervene, is an increasingly reliable predictor of longevity and good health. In addition, they argue that it is a macronutrient with a great satiating capacity that avoids the binge by impulse and improves the control of the diet. Benefits are attributed to metabolic function, musculoskeletal health, and hormonal balance. The World Health Organization has established that the recommended daily protein intake for a healthy adult is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. It is a figure that also supports the Spanish Nutrition Foundation (FEN), which also points out that in Spain 30% of the population could be exceeding the recommended limits, according to the study Distribution of macronutrients and food sources in the Spanish population: results obtained from the scientific study Anibes, which analyzed the eating habits of 2,009 individuals between 9 and 75 years old. The body mass index (BMI) is defined as the relationship between the weight of the individual (expressed in kilograms) and his or her height squared (expressed in meters). Its result classifies people into one of these four categories: low weight (BMI less than 18.5), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25.0 to 29.9) or obesity (30 or more). This mathematical formula is a measure of thick stroke health in large populations, but it is insufficient to express the complexity of metabolism and its biochemical processes. For this reason, one of the trends predicted for 2023 is the decline of BMI as an absolute metric of metabolic health. A 2016 study of more than 40,000 adults in the United States compared their BMI with more specific measurements of their health, such as insulin resistance, markers of inflammation, and blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose levels. Almost half of those who were classified as overweight and about a quarter of obese people were metabolically healthy, according to these measures. However, 31% of those with a normal body mass index were not. When we say that someone is very lucky because their metabolism is very fast we usually refer to people who seem to burn calories very quickly. There are two metrics that can measure this capacity: the Basal Metabolism Rate (BMR), which is the number of calories that are spent on the daily functioning of the body, and the Metabolic Rest Rate (MMR), which measures the number of calories that our body consumes at rest. Metabolic rates may be influenced by genetics, gender, age, muscle mass, insulin resistance, physical activity, sleep hours, feeding, meal schedules, and general health status. The most modern approach is that we are “metabolically malleable”. This means that our metabolism is not a destination and that we could act on it with personalized therapies that improve its functioning and challenge the effects of aging. Personalized metabolic health will be discussed a lot in 2023. Fitness trends for 2023 warn that we will begin to give the muscles organ entity and consider their role as predictor of a person's life expectancy. Several studies have shown that muscle strength is key in health, and much more essential in life span than had been considered so far. This systematic review published in 2022 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine argues that activities that develop muscle strength could reduce the risk of mortality by 10% to 17%. These findings consolidate muscle measurement metrics and a new culture of strength training as a way to lengthen life. From the age of 30, for every decade of life, between 3% and 8% of muscle mass is lost. Poor muscle mass is associated with the risk of cognitive impairment, increased insulin resistance and the presence of inflammatory markers. It also increases the risk of bone fractures with all associated complications. The trend for 2023 is to consider muscle strength as the new organ of longevity. The Achilles heel of this trend is that there are still no reliable methods to measure muscle mass. In the absence of an appropriate tool the recommendation is to increase strength training in all ages. In 2023 we will stop counting the 10,000 steps that the WHO commands and focus on moving, spending more hours outside the sofa or the office chair. Forbidden to run to catch the empty seat on the subway or bus, it is much healthier to continue listening to the podcast or reading the standing book and, if possible, with a contracted abdomen and a straight back. The real health marker (or lack of it) will be the inactivity rate and the hours of sofa. Sitting is the new smoke, prays a campaign in America. In 2023 the trend will be to increase movement and heart rate during daily activities, giving the same value to high intensity training at intervals as to a paced walk through a park. The underlying philosophy is that the best exercise is the one done. A study presented in 2022 at the Congress of the European Society of Cardiology showed that a ten-minute walk (or one hour per week) was related to an increase in longevity in people aged 85 and over. Specifically, 7,047 adults aged 85 years and more than those who were at least one hour a week had a lower risk of cardiovascular events. In another study of 2022 with 400,000 British adults, those who made a ten-minute energetic daily walk had the most elongated telomeres and appeared to be as young as 16 years old. Climbing stairs, avoiding elevators and escalators makes the brain look as young as three years, according to another job. Climbing stairs is even more effective at raising energy levels than a low dose of caffeine, they say here. Minimizing the hours of inactivity is the message behind emerging research into the power of micromovements. Although it is well documented that regular exercise practice is crucial for longevity, in 2023 instead of prioritizing daily pace counting or weekly gym hours, the goal will be simpler: to minimize sitting hours.

01-03-2023,"Decenas de soldados rusos mueren en uno de los ataques ucranios más letales de la guerra
","Kiev claims that 400 soldiers died under the fire of the Himars artillery, the Russian Ministry of Defense reduces the number to 63 casualties and other sources close to the invading army point to 200 dead Makiivka's 19th school became this New Year's Eve the tomb of tens—or hundreds—of Russian soldiers. Makiivka is a mining town on the outskirts of Donetsk, provincial capital, eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia since 2014. At school 19, where ammunition was also stored, a battalion of the last batch of soldiers recruited by Moscow last fall was concentrated that night. A Ukrainian artillery attack by Himars destroyed the college converted into a base, killing up to 400 Russian soldiers, according to the Ukrainian General Staff. The Russian Ministry of Defence lowers the figure to 63, but other sources close to the invading army estimate that the death toll is close to 200 recruits. Kiev claims that it would have managed to strike the most lethal blow in the war. This would be the case even if the actual figure was on horseback between the estimates of the 400 deaths of the Ukrainian army and the 63 in Moscow, that is, about the 200 soldiers liquidated. The Russian Ministry of Defence added this Monday in its daily bulletin that its bombings had eliminated 70 soldiers from the Ukrainian foreign legion at three bases in Járkov province and Donetsk. No information was provided by the Ukrainian General Staff. The attack has caused a cascade of criticism by Russian analysts who follow invading troops because they believe that there has been serious negligence. The Russian state agency TASS reported, citing Donetsk's local military authorities, that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were able to identify the target thanks to the high concentration of mobile phone signals in the building. The rules of both armies are strict in order to prevent the concentration of troops from being detected by the transmission of mobile data or the location of GPS signals of the devices. Nexta, a leading digital media outlet in Eastern Europe, said the target was identified thanks to information provided by the U.S. telecommunications spy network. This has been reported by some Russian media, although it is also common for the Ukrainian army to receive information about the movements of the enemy by people loyal to Kiev in the occupied areas. In the regions closest to the front it is equally feasible to identify the location of mobile phones on the other side of the trench from telephone towers in both sectors. The Russian Ministry of Defense has confirmed that the base was bombarded with Himars precision artillery, one of the key weapons in the Ukrainian counteroffensive and supplied by the United States. The Himars, with an 80 km radius of action, have been the nightmare of the Russian rear because they have caused multiple interruptions in the supply chain of arms and military equipment, forcing Moscow troops to move their arsenals further away from the front. The precautions against the Himars were not applied in Makiivka. The videos shared on social networks by neighbors of the city show that the explosion of the base occurred at midnight on January 1st and that the detonation was so strong that the bodies of several military personnel were projected tens of meters. The images broadcast by the Russian media confirm that the barracks were razed. Igor Girkin, a veteran Russian war officer in the Donbas condemned by international justice, published on 1 January a text in which he estimated the number of deaths at 200. Girkin criticized “the inability of [Russian] generals to form” for allowing such a concentration of units and because Ukraine has demonstrated the effectiveness of the Himars. Leading Russian military Telegram channels on the front line added that at least 100 soldiers were killed. The Grey Zone, one of Telegram's reference accounts within the Russian army in Ukraine, reported that at most it could have gathered in the 150th building, and that the death toll would be 130. The Gray Zone and Sasha Kots, a Russian journalist accompanying the invading army, have given voice to the unrest among the troops because they believe that soldiers are being blamed for not having disconnected their phones. “After ten months of war, it is dangerous and criminal to believe that the enemy is idiotic and has no eyes on everything,” Kots wrote. “Incompetence and ineptitude remain a serious problem,” he added. Ukraine struck a similar blow last October in the region of Jersón, in the south of the country, when it destroyed a barracks of the Chechen Russian forces, causing no less than 40 deaths, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Russia, for its part, claimed that last August it liquidated 200 Ukrainian soldiers in the railway municipality of Chaplino, Dnipró province. Kiev authorities never admitted soldiers there, but witnesses interviewed by THE COUNTRY at the site confirmed that dozens of soldiers were killed. In March 2022, a few weeks after the invasion began, Russia bombed a barracks in Mikolaiv province where 40 to 100 recruits were killed, according to the AFP agency. Another Russian Telegram account widely followed about the war, Voienii Osvodomiel, pointed out that Ukrainian senior commanders learned from attacks such as Mikolaiv's to distribute to troops, without concentrating them, and in less exposed buildings. “If responsibility is not transferred to the official level, if the media does not dare to name those responsible, well-known people, everyone will show that nothing has happened,” lamented this source. The attack on Makiivka coincided with a large-scale Russian attack on Kiev with missiles and bomb drones. Since the afternoon of 31 December, Russian air forces have relentlessly punished the Ukrainian capital. In the early morning of 2 January, more than 22 Shahed drones arrived in the city, out of a total of 39 who were shot in the country, according to the Ukrainian air force. The explosions were repeated until after three in the morning. The unmanned vehicles were largely hit by air defences, but two hit their targets and Kiev's energy grid again suffered damage that have caused further power cuts on Monday. Two dozen homes in the capital were damaged, but no one had to regret the death of anyone.

","The 28-year-old grew up in the Andalusian capital, fled his country to not go to war in Ukraine, but he cannot meet his Spanish mother because of bureaucratic problems When Vitaly Agilar was doing military service in Murmansk, in 2016, he devised a plan in case the Russian government decided to send him to fight Syria: to flee to Morocco, a country that does not require a visa, to be closer to Seville, where his host family lives and where he grew up since he was eight years old and went for the first time to the Andalusian capital to spend the summers, through a program of a Spanish-Russian NGO. He never thought that those cavilations he fantasized about in the North Sea would come true on October 8, 2022, the date he escaped from Moscow with his wife, Anna, destined for Rabat to avoid going to the Ukrainian front and fighting for a cause he does not believe in. Vitaly's 28-year-old goal of meeting with his mother Carmen and her three brothers, however, has not come out as he dreamed in the Arctic. The bureaucratic tangle of Spanish legislation has prevented him from obtaining the necessary visa to go to Spain and apply for asylum. The exhaustion of time to stay on Moroccan soil legally has forced him to travel with his partner to an Asian country — which he prefers not to reveal — where he mislives while consuming his scarce financial resources, the deadlines of his tourist visa and, above all, his hopes of meeting with his Spanish family. “I finished the ESO in Spain, studied a cooking module, studied at the Gambrinus School and did the internships at the Hotel Colón and at the restaurant of Manuel de la Hoz, which has a Michelin star. I have a good résumé, but that's not all that's important. What counts is my family, my mother and my brothers, who have fought for me since childhood. That for the Spanish State does not count”, laments in a perfect Spanish with Andalusian accent in telephone conversation, at 12 p.m., just when he has finished his working day at the hotel where he and Anna clean rooms for 12 hours a day. “We, too, run away from war because we don’t support what’s happening, but we’re Russians and they look at all the papers,” he adds. The life in Spain that Vitaly sums up in just one sentence relates it profusely Carmen Aguilar, his Spanish mother, with the photo album by hand to illustrate the story of his fourth son. “He’s the only one I haven’t given birth to, but as I always tell him, his birth has cost me the most,” he says with a half smile. It is the only relaxed gesture that is allowed, because it carries the anguish grasped in his gaze and in his voice. He does not understand how if Vitaly has roots, a family in Spain and possibilities to work immediately is wandering around half the world and stranded at the other end of the planet. “He is on his way to becoming a stateless person, in fact, because if he returned to Russia he would be sent to war or jail,” he says. Carmen Aguilar, 71, met Vitaly when he was eight, almost by chance. “The family that was going to welcome him that summer backed off and, as I had just been widowed and didn’t feel like going to the beach, I offered,” she explains. The cohabitation was very problematic during the first weeks, but quickly “the child entered us all by the soul”, recognizes his mother. Little by little, he understood the hard past Vitaly had gone through in his first seven years of life. Son of an alcoholic mother without a known father, he went out to get bread only until he took a train from St. Petersburg to Moscow, where a policeman found him and ended up in an orphanage. After spending Christmas with the child in Russia—”so he wasn’t alone in the orphanage,” says Aguilar—he managed to make the full school year in Seville at nine years old. However, just then the maternal grandfather appeared and demanded that Vitaly return to Russia even though he was sent to the orphanage. When the child was 14 years old, this relative agreed to his return to Spain. He practiced hospitality and chained works in prestigious restaurants in the Andalusian capital. In summer he traveled to his home country to be with his grandparents. There she fell in love with a young woman and decided to leave her life in Spain, against the advice of her mother, who urged her to stay in order to obtain nationality by rooting. As soon as he arrived in Russia, he was forced to do military service. When he finished it, his partner broke up with him and left him in debt. She met Anna, married her, and the war in Ukraine broke out. “My mother told me to come now, but having a legal claim for the debt did not give us visas,” Vitaly explains. In August they managed to finish it, but the procedures for obtaining documentation to fly to Spain took two months to be ready. “And at the end of September forced recruitment was approved. My brother Juanje told me to get out of there, my mother too...” he continues. Vitaly remembered the plans he had forged in the North Sea and bought the tickets for Morocco. The flight left on October 8 and the previous day in the afternoon, a Russian official knocked on his door with the papers for the mandatory cam. They didn't open him. Meanwhile, his Spanish mother had already told the Spanish embassy in Rabat that her son was coming and that he wanted to seek asylum. When the young man came to the diplomatic delegation, he was told that this was a matter for the consulate. It was the first bureaucratic setback he hit. Thanks to his speaking Spanish, the consulate’s security guard got him to receive an official — “another compatriot stayed at the door,” says Vitaly. There he was told that he could not be granted asylum when he was in a third country, but that he could be granted a visa to enter Spain and apply for it here. Then began the transfer of documentation. “I even had to declare to the notary that I would take over my son and his wife financially when they were here,” says Carmen Aguilar. With a bundle of reports under her arm, on 20 October she flew to Rabat to deliver them to the consulate and, above all, to check on Vitaly. It didn't help. The Government denied the young man the visa on the grounds that “there were reasonable doubts that when the time expired, they would stay in our country,” explains the woman. “They weren’t reasonable doubts, that’s what we told them we were going to do right from the start. It was the only way to apply for asylum, to have legal access to Spain, but if you cannot enter, how can you ask?” he questions. “At that moment it all came to me,” says Vitaly. His despair reached the extreme of passing to Spain clandestinely in a truck. “I have a Moroccan friend who came in like this and I asked him, but he didn’t have the contacts anymore,” he says. His mother and brothers immediately deterred him. The time was running and before exhausting the three-month period of his tourist visa, Vitaly and Anna flew to the far east on December 1. The owner of the hotel where they stayed has provided them with work, accommodation and food. “We work 12 hours a day and only have two days of rest a month. Since we arrived we have not stepped on the street but to go to the supermarket,” says Vitaly. He has again contacted the Spanish embassy in Moscow, but he has already been told that if he has been refused a visa once, it must take some time before he can apply again. In the country where he is, he can only stay for two months, then he must leave so he can go back in and stay for another month. His Spanish mother has written to the Ministry of the Interior, without getting a reply, and has just made a request for help to the Ombudsman. Since she met Vitaly, this woman has not stopped fighting for the well-being of her son, who changed his last name for his own, although he was transcribed without Aguilar's u. He made endless queues at the Foreign Office of Plaza de España in Seville to get the child to stay in this country. He traveled every Christmas to Moscow to be with him. It cost him an ear operation and remembers that he slept at Moscow airport when, during the time he lived permanently in Spain, he accompanied him during the summers so that he could see his grandparents. He's made friends with the translators he's needed for all the paperwork. He sent money to Russia to help him when he was in debt. He keeps his clothes and shirts and other memories of his football team, Sevilla FC, for when he can return. “He’s running away from killing and getting killed, like Ukrainians, but he has Russian in his passport,” he laments. On the black market they ask Vitaly 3,000 euros for visas, but don't trust them. Nor can he raise so much money with what little he and Anna earn and do not want to resort to his mother's help. He is waiting “for something to happen” for that plan that he naively devised six years ago in the middle of the polar cold to end up in the final destination that he imagined: “Being with my family.” “Over the course of my 28 years I have spent them canutas, I have seen everything, I have lived many things and if it hadn’t been for my family I wouldn’t have become who I am, I wouldn’t have gotten to where I am,” says Vitaly.","Russian military serviceman Vitaly Agilar, who fled to Morocco in 2022 to avoid fighting in Syria, is living in an Asian country.",NEU,0.9623255133628845

","The former PP treasurer, who will also collaborate in a social dining room, leaves the prison open between 7.30 a.m. and 11 p.m. The prison situation of the former PP treasurer and former PP treasurer Luis Bárcenas has taken a radical turn in recent days. To remain closed in the prison of Soto del Real (Madrid), without being able to leave more than when he was granted a permit, he has been able to leave for more than 15 hours a day the center of social insertion in the center of the capital in which since last week he has served his sentence in semi-liberty, according to the detailed sources of the penitentiary to EL COUNTRY and confirms the defense of the politician. In particular, the former treasurer is authorized to leave from 7.30 a.m. to 11 p.m., in addition to spending every weekend and holidays at his home, after he has justified before the General Secretariat of Penitentiary Institutions that he has a job as an accountant for a company of his son Guillermo, musician and leader of the Taburete band, and that he is appointed as a volunteer in the social dining room governed by a religious order, details sources of his defense. The latter activity has not yet started it. “He’s waiting for them to call him,” the latter sources add. Bárcenas was sentenced to 29 years and one month's imprisonment by the Supreme Court in October 2020 for its involvement in the Gürtel case, although a court subsequently determined that the maximum time to be spent in prison could not exceed 12 years, which corresponds to three times the penalty for its most serious crime, in this case, money laundering and against the Public Treasury, both of which were sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Of those twelve years, it has already reached more than half: six years and two months. The change in the prison situation in Bárcenas is the result of the recent decision of the Ministry of the Interior to apply to it article 100.2 of the Prison Regulations, a rule that allows for the relaxation of the regime of prison life of a second-degree prisoner (the ordinary one, in which more than 70 per cent of those convicted in Spain) to enjoy part of the benefits of prisoners classified as third-degree or open-ended. In that decision he weighed that the former treasurer had already enjoyed about twenty exit permits without any incident (the last one, to spend Christmas Eve at his home), had shown good behavior during his imprisonment and was participating in a reintegration program that includes group meetings of restorative justice with victims of different crimes. The last, with a woman who had suffered a sexual offence, according to sources of her defense. These programmes, which are voluntary, do not entail any prison benefits, but Prisons do take them into account when granting them. Following the Interior decision, Bárcenas entered the Victoria Kent Social Integration Center on December 27 (in the center of Madrid and where prisoners in semi-freedom are serving their sentences). There he was interviewed on the same day by the educator, the jurist, the psychologist and the social worker of the center, and subjected to a review by the nursing service. Two days later, the treatment board—an organ made up of prison professionals, including those who interviewed him—designed the execution plan that the former treasurer must follow for what is left of his sentence, including the departure schedule that will allow him to spend much of the day outside the center that he only goes to sleep at between Monday and Thursday. However, sources of the former treasurer's defence stress that the measure is not yet final and that it may be appealed by the Public Prosecutor's Office before the prison supervision judge at first instance and, subsequently, before the court of the National High Court which judged him. In May, the treatment board will re-examine the prison classification of Bárcenas. The former treasurer aspires to be classified as a third degree or open regime, a situation that would not substantially change the day-to-day that he has now begun to enjoy, but which is essential for him to be able to apply for early parole in September 2024. According to the calculations made by this newspaper, at that time he will have served two thirds of the sentence of 12 years. In order to aspire to this freedom, regulated by article 90.2 of the Criminal Code, the prisoner must have served this part of the sentence and be classified as a third degree, in addition to fulfilling other requirements such as having had good behavior and having “developed work, cultural or occupational activities [...] from which there has been a significant and favorable modification of those of his personal circumstances related to his previous criminal activity”. One year later, in September 2025, the former treasurer will have served three quarters of the sentence. At that time, the law provides for a second possibility of access to parole. The requirements are similar to early release — being classified as third grade and good behavior — but no longer requiring participation in work or cultural activities. The last date reflected in his prison record is the final execution and termination of the sentence. Bárcenas will reach it in September 2028.","Luis Brcenas is allowed to leave the prison of Soto del Real for more than 15 hours a day to work as an accountant for his son Guillermo, musician and leader of the Taburete band.",NEU,0.9644705653190613
