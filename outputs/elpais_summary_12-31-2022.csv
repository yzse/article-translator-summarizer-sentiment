12-31-2022,"Lecciones de la guerra en Ucrania: de la flaqueza de Putin a los límites de Occidente
","Russian aggression shows an extraordinary portrait of the military capabilities of the forces involved as well as the geopolitical positioning of the countries of the world ""There are many lessons that spring from the war in Ukraine. Lessons we are learning. That Europeans learn. That President Xi and the Chinese armed forces learn,” said General Mark Milley, president of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently. Political, military and business leaders from all over the planet investigate the conflict in search of keys to understanding the modern world, the balance of strength, the future flow of events. What are these lessons?This is an abundant catalogue, relevant, full of nuances. At the military level, of course, because it is the first great confrontation in decades between one of the world's greatest war powers and an adversary with remarkable conventional potential. But not only in the military, but also in the geopolitical, because, as Pol Morillas, director of the CIDOB centre of international studies points out, “Russian invasion is an ordago that challenges the current world order,” and in that sense it concerns and portrays everyone. Next, an attempt to point out some of the great lessons of the war in Ukraine in 2022. The conflict is, at the outset, a reminder of the enormous difficulty of invading a country with an adversary who, although inferior in terms of means, is determined to defend his independence. “It is in a sense the same lesson as Vietnam,” says William Alberque, director of the Arms Strategy, Technology and Control department of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Or Afghanistan, among others. But the case of Ukraine has a special value because it allows to project with precision the calculation on a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan, the most dangerous tension zone in the world, based on a very similar scheme: offensive of great power (Russia/China) against inferior adversary (Ukraine/Taiwan), but with military support of the highest power (USA) and strong sanctioning reaction (of the western bloc). “China is no doubt studying events with growing panic, understanding that a hypothetical attack on Taiwan would be much more difficult and costly than it assumed until recently,” says the expert, who previously was director of the NATO Arms Control Center. But the dynamics of war in Ukraine and the Russian setbacks say much more, starting with the pre-invasion phase. The development of events underlines, for example, the critical importance of adequate intelligence and analytical capacity. The Kremlin completely failed to weigh the resistance that Ukraine would oppose and the reaction of the West. This analytical short circuit led to a maximalist strategy of attack that proved completely wrong. “Western services, on the other hand, had a remarkable performance, greatly improving with respect to past crises,” says Cathryn Clüwer Ashbrook, Executive Vice President of the Bertelsmann Foundation. The U.S. saw the invasion coming, properly transmitted the information to the Allies, and this facilitated preparatory work. At the tactical operational level, the inability of Russian forces to react with agility to the problems encountered on the battlefield has emphasized the importance of command and control structures that delegate a margin of operational discretion to well-prepared intermediate officers. “In Western forces this is praxis,” says Alberque, but the invasion has shown a harmful level of rigidity in the Russian chain of command, as many experts have argued, including those of the British Royal Institute of Services. On the contrary, the Ukrainian forces have demonstrated an extraordinary capacity for adaptation and flexibility. In the first case, learning to use and integrate dozens of different types of weapons; in the second, reacting intelligently to tactical challenges. “I think this war will be studied a lot in 50 or 100 years, and I think Ukrainian officials will teach for decades in Western military academies, largely to explain the extraordinary adaptability and flexibility they have shown,” Alberque says. The merit of the enormous setbacks suffered by Russia lies to a large extent in those qualities and in the courage of the Ukrainian forces against an opponent with much less motivation. But their resilience to an enemy with greater means also points to persistent Western military superiority. The training and intelligence provided, as well as, of course, weapons, have undoubtedly played an important role. Even without delivering the most sophisticated systems, Western support has had a fundamental weight, which reminds us that two decades of supposed great modernization of Russian forces on paper have produced a very mediocre result. Here, China will also be recalculating the real potential of untested modernization investments. “The war has made us see many things: that Russian forces rely more on Western technology than we thought, that the level of internal corruption is higher than we thought, and that the share of well-equipped and trained troops was small compared to a large majority with lower standards,” Alberque says. “However, to conclude as some do that the Russian armed forces are pathetic would be a serious mistake. They have suffered serious setbacks, lost a lot of material, are not flexible in command and control like Europeans, but they rely on volume, and remain a rather formidable force. There is a risk of overestimating their problems,” continues the analyst. Clüwer Ashbrook agrees: “They have suffered a lot, but they are not sunk. They're still there. They also learn, adapt, moving their arsenals away from the new Ukrainian reach, unleashing a barbaric offensive against civilian structures. They also have resilience.” Just as Russian difficulties should not precipitate too radical conclusions, neither is it rational to conclude that all are lights for the West. The Ukrainian conflict shows how unprepared many of its arsenals and industry are to sustain prolonged friction warfare efforts, Alberque says. There is a lack of ammunition, sufficient spare parts for certain items. “Probably the high concentration of spending on a small number of sophisticated weapons programs is also a mistake,” says the IISS expert. The conflict has also demonstrated the need to recalibrate anti-aircraft defences. Both high-quality systems are needed to intercept ballistic missiles, as well as simpler, widely usable systems to defuse the potential for cheap drone swarms. As for the cyber domain, the conflict shows that a well-organized defense can deactivate a potentially annihilating tool. This section, according to Alberque, recalls the need for thorough preparation to adapt to the threats posed by adversaries. Ukraine's resilience lies in the fact that it has been in combat with Russia since 2014 and since then, albeit with limited means, has made extraordinary efforts to adapt to the risks. The expert believes that many European countries have not adequately prepared themselves to face serious military challenges. In geopolitical terms, perhaps the main considerations linked to the invasion are a lesson and a portrait. The lesson is the risks inherent in the excessive dependence of an adversary on a connected world as never before. The portrait is the picture of the state of strength and the positioning of countries and blocs in the face of the will to change the world order that, among other things, the Russian attack represents. In the first aspect, in addition to the total decoupling of the West and Russia, it is worth highlighting the movements of the former to reduce their dependence on China. This covers different areas of supply chains, including strategic raw materials, as demonstrated by the European Commission's plan to foster greater EU resilience in this section. “The big question is how far this decoupling will go. The level of interconnection is such that I think it is most likely a selective decoupling,” says Morillas. ""It is a very complex movement that will generate tensions within countries, within the EU and within the transatlantic community. China is aware of the enormous strategic asset that this dependence entails, and tries to cultivate it,” says Clüwer Ashbrook. As for the vigor and positioning of countries and blocs, the moment has been revealing. The West has responded “with a considerable degree of unity” to the invasion, according to Clüwer Ashbrook. The response in terms of sanctions against Russia and military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine has been swift and very significant. The expert highlights how the preconditions were far from ideal, not only because of the tear between the two sides of the Atlantic that occurred during the Trump stage, but also because of the frictions that surfaced even in Biden's, as evidenced by the withdrawal from Afghanistan or the Aukus pact (the military agreement signed between the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia). Both these disagreements and the alleged dynamics of decline of the West in the early months of the century, with the economic crisis of 2008, the triumph of populist forces, with the weak reaction to Russia's offensives in Georgia (2008), Ukraine (2014) and Syria (2015) were, along with other factors, among Putin's elements of calculation. All these elements are being reconsidered on a global scale, with the renewed vigour of NATO — which Macron declared a state of brain coma a few years ago. The West closed ranks, and has acted effectively. Moreover, within Europe, “the EU’s ability to converge ranks and find quick, functional solutions has been quite impressive,” says Ashbrook, drawing attention to many problematic elements, such as Hungary’s vetoes. Morillas agrees in appreciating the resilience of the Atlantic link and of the European reaction and also invites to maintain an important caution in its long-term projection. The year of the invasion has made it clear that there is nothing comparable in the world to the degree of union displayed by NATO countries, the EU and its Asia/Pacific partners, such as Japan, South Korea or Australia. Russia, on the other hand, has not found support open to its brutal challenge to the world order. The invasion is an imperialist movement, of reaffirmation of power in its surroundings, but also a brutal manifestation of rejection of the world order embodied around Western values after World War II. Moscow no doubt longs to be the pioneer of a broad subversion movement. But, for the moment, this one is not coming true. China, which signed a declaration with Russia in February that precisely presented a vision of an alternative global order and announced a relationship with Russia without limits, has shown that the limits exist: it does not want a disruption of the global economic order or irritate the West to the point of profoundly disrupting the commercial interbrication from which it draws so much profit. Even so, in the geopolitical as in the military section, the central assertions are full of nuances. “In short, the reaction of the West has been remarkable; but measures have not yet been taken to ensure that this revival will last. There remain problems and strategic differences among Western partners,” says Morillas. Clüwer Ashbrook warns, in particular, that within the EU it should not be taken for granted that cohesion remains and remains effective. The expert points out the clear cracks in the Franco-German axis, and a shock to the usual Western/East balance of power within the EU, with the credibility of the first touch, while the countries of the second claim the validity of their historical vision of alert to Russia, as well as to bear an important part of the burden of hosting refugees and helping Ukraine. On the other hand, if the core of the liberal democracies that unites some 40 countries in Europe, North America and Asia/Pacific has closed well ranks, the West has not been able to gain strong support in the global South. Dozens of these countries voted against the U.N. invasion — totalling 141, compared to the 4 who voted with Russia, 35 abstentions and 12 who did not exercise the right to vote — but have not joined the sanctions. The 35 who abstained in that vote represent half of the world ' s population. The non-aligned strongly defend their position, and cases such as that of Saudi Arabia — a traditional ally of the United States that has maintained its own course in oil production policy — or of India embody it well. “New Delhi does not like the invasion, let alone nuclear threats, but does not bow to the wishes of the West. It makes it clear that it has its interests, a huge market to supply energy, and as long as Russian crude oil is good for it and the West offers nothing better, it is still on its way,” says Clüwer Ashbrook. “In this more complex, more multipolar world, the middle powers try to play a weighty role,” adds Morillas. In this context, even with heavy blows such as the asset freeze, sanctions against Russia have a limited scope. The Russian economy has contracted, undoubtedly facing serious production problems due to a lack of components, but there has been no collapse, the ruble remains stable. These are some considerations linked to the war in Ukraine. There are, of course, many more, from the fundamental role of leadership and communication to reflection on the cost of not vigorously objecting to certain scores in time, and then having to endure a much greater onslaught. It subdues to all the eternal lesson, shared by all conflicts, of the enormous suffering of civilians. Among many other things, the unjustified and illegal Russian aggression will be remembered by the abjection of submerging the non-combatant population in the dark and cold.

12-31-2022,"Jersón celebró con júbilo el fin de la ocupación rusa; ahora el Kremlin se venga arrasando la ciudad
","After his retreat across the Dnieper River, Putin's army unceasingly attacks the town that was his greatest victory. Joy has given way to hopelessness in some citizens Stanislav sharpens the ear and hastily closes the trunk of his broken red Lada. The car is going to overflow with water claws, milk cans and tea packs that load for the few remaining neighbors in the area. There's no time for delivery. A soldier runs from the bank of the river and takes cover, crouching against the red brick wall of a house. “One, two, three, four... 15,” the uniform recites, waiting. An explosion rumbles in the neighborhood of Naftohavan, in Jerson. And then another one. And another. On the other side of the Dnieper, less than a kilometer away, there is a position of the Kremlin troops. The waters of the river have become a grey area, on the front line of the battle line over which the Russian missiles that ravage Naftohavan and all of Jerson fly. A city that celebrated in November with joy the withdrawal of Vladimir Putin's forces after eight months of occupation, and in which the joy of liberation has faded like a sugar in the muddy waters of the Dnieper, under missiles, mortars, drone bombs. Russia has lost Jerson and now it blows it up, as if it wanted to tear it to the ground. Naftohavan, of low houses, some extremely flirtatious, and other constructions of precarious wood, was once planted with rural houses and businesses of water activities. Now, its proximity to the river has made it one of the most dangerous points of Jerson, in the sights of Russian projectiles but also of snipers. “It’s not just that they want to come back, they’re getting revenge. And if we don’t get killed by missiles, they want to kill us in fear,” says Stanislav, a man who is white, with brown skin and yellow nails from the nicotine of cigarettes he smokes non-stop. “But if they didn’t scare us when they were here, neither now,” he says. Since Vladimir Putin's troops left Jerusalem—stealing everything they could, including the treasures and relics of the art museum—in early November, the city's daily life, which before the invasion had some 300,000 inhabitants, is summed up in constant attacks, explains Commander Kostantin. Muscular and slender, the former member of the special forces reincorporated into the Ukrainian army in the early months of the invasion, moves safely through the ruined airport of the city in which he was born, a place planted with gutted planes and remnants of what was one of the most promising airfields in southern Ukraine. The farthest tracks still hide mines. Like a round, unexploded device that Commander Kostia discovers in the grass and points out with his modern American rifle, his personal weapon. “Nothing will be safe at all until we get those orcs [as many Ukrainians call Russian soldiers] out of the burrows,” says the military. The Ukrainian army has reinforced its positions in Jerson and is trying to push Russian troops from the adjacent riverbank, but for the moment all attempts to take control of that point of the Dnieper and to send incursions beyond the grey zone have been fruitless. Jerson, considered a strategic city and the gate of the Crimean peninsula — illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 — quickly fell into Russian hands in early March, during the early days of the invasion. The Kremlin had worked on it, noting a source of Ukrainian intelligence. He had collaborators inside: in the regional and local administration, in the police, some businessmen in the area. In addition, his defense was not designed in an exemplary manner either. But Putin took much more than he could cover. And a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, fueled by well-trained troops, information and weapons that Western partners have provided to Kiev, forced Kremlin forces to withdraw. The loss of Jersón, who was sending grain from his port to half the world before the war, has been a very hard setback for Putin. It was the only regional capital that had conquered since the beginning of the offensive in February. Russian forces have now moved to defensive positions across the Dnieper River. From there, they subject Jerson to a constant rain of projectiles. On December 25, when Ukraine’s allies and many of the country’s Catholics and Orthodox were preparing to eat with their families to celebrate Christmas, Russia unleashed on Jerson what Irina Mijailova describes as “armageddon.” Since that day, the octogenarian has not moved from her home. He spends the day at the doors of his building, sitting on a stand on some woods, clinging to his wooden staff and chatting with his neighbor Tatiana. Three attacks on the city centre killed 11 people and injured 70 that day. More than 40 mortars fell on the streets of the city. The Russian projectiles killed a woman who sold SIM cards for mobile phones in the street, a social worker, a butcher, a young man who had gone to Jerson to evacuate his sick mother. He followed the lives of people who had approached the city center in search of cash or to buy in the central market. Not too far away, the main square of Jersón, presided over by the administration building, which hosted jubilant celebrations for the liberation of the city and in which the president of Ukraine, Volodimir Zelenski, raised the flag of the country on an emotional visit, is almost deserted. Just a couple of people walk the sidewalks in a pacifying December. It's starting to get dark and a yellow trail runs through the sky. In another life it could be a shooting star and yet it is an incendiary projectile. Irina Mijailova was a teacher for years in a city she loved deeply. It took him a long time to get his little apartment, he says. “We had a good life. Now I know,” he laments. In his house, he says, it's colder than on the street. Miraculously, there is water and, from time to time, light; but there is no heating. Russia is vigorously applying itself to Ukraine's energy system to try to break the resistance of the citizenry. And in Jerson, the problems of supply are compounded by the anxiety of living under continuous attack, especially during the night. Since December 25, hundreds of people have left the city and the authorities are asking those left to leave. In the entire block of Irina Mijailova and Tatiana, which for years led one of the city's trolleybus routes, there are only four people and a colony of kittens, running through the courtyard full of gaps and debris. Some crystals are broken, but the apartment building of Irina Mijailova has run better luck than the one on the corner, completely smashed. It smells like light. Someone's lit a bonfire. Very close to the ruins, the generator buzzes that nourishes a small café-bar. Outside, two men talk, standing, while drinking beer in plastic glasses. “It’s early and we’re already drunk, what we’re going to do,” one throws, dressed in a red camouflage suit with a waterproof look. The regulations prohibit the sale of alcohol in the city, both for civilians and for the military. But the little bar still has a pretty drink-worthy card, and the uniforms seem to turn a blind eye. The man in a camouflage suit pulls out his mobile phone and with shaky fingers searches his gallery: “I have nothing left, you know?” And it shows a video of a totally collapsed low house. Beams, debris and twisted wood. It's his house. A Russian missile shot her down a week ago. There hasn't been a day in weeks when an attack hasn't killed anyone in Jerson. Or reach someone's house. On Wednesday, a Russian projectile impacted the maternity wing of a hospital. Thursday, at a medical center specializing in cardiology. Maria, or “Grandmother Mary”, as she likes to present herself, has arranged herself, as every morning, in a house without light or gas. She has painted her lips pink almost matching her violet beret and has gone down to the street, where she watches a group of men trying to fix an electric pole in the Antonovka neighborhood, too close to the river. The soil and grass are full of debris and Grandma Maria says that a few days ago debris from a rocket fell on the area. He claims that he celebrated the withdrawal of Russian troops and the arrival of the Ukrainian army as well, after living eight months practically locked up at home, with “fear even of breathing.” But she's tired. And angry. “I may be told that I am ungrateful, but this is a hardship. Not only the attacks, we have nothing, there are hardly any shops open here, there are no banks and it is almost impossible to collect the pension,” he says. The men who swirl to lift the pole point to disgust that humanitarian aid reaches the neighborhood with droplets. And the one that does it is a private organization, an evangelical church. They're complaining about the administration. They feel neglected. “It’s not that we lived better with the Russians, those fascists, that’s true, but I thought things would be another way,” laments Grandma Maria. City inside, in one of the few supermarkets open these days, there is no pin. Boxes with new products accumulate in the corridors, still unplaced. The assortment is good and showy. And the prices, similar to those of other places in Ukraine. While pulling from a plastic basket with a solitary bottle of sunflower oil, Oleksandr and his wife Sveta explain that during the Russian occupation prices were in rubles and everything was much more expensive. Sveta, blond hair picked up on a ponytail, clung to her husband's arm and whispered that her 20-year-old son had been detained by Moscow troops at the beginning of the invasion. He's been missing for 10 days. He never left home again: “I’ve already experienced a nightmare, what else can happen to us? We're being bombed? Kill us? That they don't come back, I'll settle for it. I hope they will sweep you off the face of this earth, even if you are no longer here to see it.” Follow all international information on Facebook and Twitter, or on our weekly newsletter.","Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrated the withdrawal of his forces from the Ukrainian city of Jerson in November, but the joy of liberation has faded like a sugar in the muddy waters of the Dnieper, under missiles, mortars and drone bombs.",NEU,0.823756992816925
12-31-2022,"Elon Musk o cómo dilapidar 124.000 millones en un año
","Frenchman Bernard Arnault, owner of LVMH, snatches from the South African tycoon the richest man scepter in the world. The 20 most wealthy see their heritage set back by nearly 34 billion in 2022 After a sweet 2021 for Elon Musk, when he crowned himself as the richest man in the world, a 2022 aciago. The U.S. businessman, in the eye of the hurricane since he became head of the Twitter social network in October, has seen his still vast fortune evaporated by 132 billion dollars (124 billion euros). Most of that fall, which has relegated him to second place in the global ranking of millionaires, is linked to Tesla's stock market bust: in 12 months, the electric car manufacturer who founded and runs, has lost two thirds of its value. A trend fuelled by the sales of shares executed by Musk himself. Tesla’s torment — which, however, had exponentially multiplied its market value in recent years — is by no means an isolated case among technological companies, companies that in record time have gone from living days of wine and roses — especially during the pandemic — to being forced to apply staffing cuts and costs to temper the concerns of their shareholders. The Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), Amazon or Microsoft stock market hit has caused a real earthquake in the world ranking of billionaires, with their founders losing positions to forced marches. Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) has moved from sixth to not even one of the 20 greatest fortunes on the planet; Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Alphabet) are down from fifth and seventh in 2021 to tenth and eleventh in 2022; and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) is displaced from second to sixth. Only Bill Gates (Microsoft) maintains his position in the ranking, the fourth, although with a strong loss in the total value of his fortune, which goes from 138.000 to just over 109 billion dollars, according to Bloomberg's data. Musk's is, however, a separate case. Not only because he is the one who is most affected by his heritage, but because of his erratic behavior in recent months, especially after the purchase of Twitter. Knowing the fears, the controversial and iconoclastic businessman of South African origin sent this week an e-mail to Tesla’s employees — in many cases, also affected by the stock market shock, because part of their salary is paid in shares — asking them to calm down: “Don’t worry too much about the insanity of the stock market. As we demonstrate continuous excellent performance, the market will recognize it. In the long term, I firmly believe that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth,” he predicted. In a year of maximum volatility, both in the macroeconomic and the parquet sectors, which have suffered both from the uncertainty of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and from the aggressiveness with which central banks have responded to the inflationary escalation, the aggregate wealth of the world’s 20 greatest fortunes fell by $360 billion (336 billion euros). But the coup has not been much less symmetrical: the traditional sectors have weathered the storm much better. The best proof of this is the Frenchman Bernard Arnault, the top shareholder of the French luxury conglomerate LVMH (Dom Pérignon, Hennessy, Christian Dior, Bvlgari...), who a couple of weeks ago overcame Musk and became the richest man on the planet. It has been decades since a European closed the year leading the classification of billionaires, the historic private quota of Americans. Everything, despite seeing his fortune reduced by more than 13 billion. The other example of how the classic, defensive sectors have resisted much better than technology the impact of uncertainty and the escalation of interest rates, is the Indian Gautam Adani, already settled as the third most wealthy man in the globe. Head of an emporium that bears his name and encompasses endless businesses — from mining to sport — he has taken advantage of the juicy opportunity offered by the energy crisis to strengthen his own solid financial position. The bursting of coal prices has been a powerful tail wind, as have the bottlenecks in international trade: while global supply chains suffered the unspeakable, the division of their holding dedicated to maritime transport was made of gold. Adani is not just the first Asian to settle on the podium of billionaires. He is also the second national of an emerging country to do so, after the Mexican Carlos Slim, who now occupies twelfth place. His recent jump — a year ago it was fourteenth and until shortly before he didn't even make it into the top 20 — has been exponential: after doubling his fortune in 2021, this 2022 is scored a net gain of 44.6 billion dollars, an advance within reach of very few. And it contains a reading beyond the individual, of a geoeconomic order: India, a giant that is about to overcome China as the most populated country on the face of the Earth, already has two names in the bouquet of the eight richest in the world. The second in discord is Mukesh Ambani, the top shareholder of Reliance Industries, another colossus with interests in logistics, energy, telecommunications or infrastructure, among others. Despite Western domination — 17 of the richest 20 are Americans or Europeans — India's strength and, therefore, Asia can be interpreted almost as an advance in the coming world: the centre of gravity of trade and economy has already shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific; and heritages, sooner or later, will follow its wake. From the global to the domestic. The founder of Inditex (Zara, Massimo Dutti, Bershka...), Amancio Ortega, remained in 2022 as the richest Spanish, with an estimated fortune of 55.2 billion dollars. They are, however, 12.3 billion less than at the end of 2021, a decline that dissipates them from the top 20, largely due to the loss of value accumulated by the textile firm, which is left almost 13% in a marked exercise from beginning to end by the war in Ukraine. Russia was, until March, the second most important market of the Galician company by number of shops. A first-order blow that has billed Ortega.","Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla, loses his position as the richest man in the world.",NEU,0.5400217771530151
12-31-2022,"Francisco Goldman: “Hay una nueva manera de leer con el afán de una policía moral”
","With ‘Monkey Boy’, the American writer endorses his mastery of the autobiographical novel and exploits memory as a literary space: a place of fact and fiction as well. He was beaten at home, humiliated at school and, as a son of a Jew and a Catholic Latina, an unidentified ethnic object in the Boston suburbs of that time. Through an ‘alter ego’, he courageously goes back to his life with a sense of humor that is lacking in the era of political correctness.There are not many people with the saving gift of laughing with laughter. Francisco Goldman (Boston, 68) is fortunate to be one of them. Without him he might not have been able to endure so much horror: his father's contempt and beatings; coverage of the Central American wars; the death of his first wife, writer Aura Estrada, by a wave that beat her against the sand and severed her spinal cord. Her love story with her and the final tragedy told them in a memorable work, Say her name (Sixth Floor, 2011). The subsequent duel overturned him in El circuito interior (Turner, 2014), a chronicle of his catharsis in his adopted homeland, Mexico City. In Monkey Boy (Storage; translation by Daniel Saldaña Paris) explores his childhood traumas and completes with the two previous books a trilogy that is a high level of the autobiographical novel. Recognized in 2022 with the American Book Award and Pulitzer finalist, it is a mosaic of memories that the author puts in the mouth of an alter ego named Frankie Goldberg, a name written on his own with which he mocks our pruritus of knowing what part of a book—and of oneself—is truth or lie. Frankie, like Francisco, today a blessed father of family who attends us on a visit to Madrid, is a child of the suburbs of Boston who in the school they nicknamed “chimpanzee boy”, son of Guatemalan mother, Catholic, sweet and fun, and father of Ukrainian origin, secular Jew, dental prosthetic, Democratic voter, lover of horticulture and fierce enemy of his own family. His name is Bert Goldberg, like that of Francis, who, likewise, made false teeth. Was Bert Goldman also a bad person?Well, I don't know if I'd say he was a bad person. Mostly I see him as a sick person, with a rage he could not control, against life, against us, against himself. However, he gave others the impression that he was a righteous and kind man. All the kids in the neighborhood loved him and came to help him with the garden. My mom said, “Your dad likes every family but his.” You didn't work with him in the garden. Never. Because I didn't leave him or because I didn't want to?I didn't want to and he wouldn't let me. Not as a child, especially as a child, I was afraid of him. I started really hating him when I was a teenager. And he hit him, just like Frankie Goldberg in the book — “as driven by the urge to end him once and for all.” Yeah, exactly like in that scene. The novel is full of invented things, but this I wanted to tell literally, and it was very strong to revive those emotions. Like the night he beat me up in front of some cops at a police station. Upon arriving home I felt so much hatred that, if someone had given me a knife, at that time I would have killed him, and maybe I would have killed my mom too for being so passive in front of him. It was terrifying. While I was writing, I didn't see it coming, I got there and it freaked me out. All that anger stored up for years. What was wrong with your father?For my book is not a psychoanalysis work or anything like that, but one can speculate. His rage could come from being trapped in a life he hated, could come from self-hate, could come from being very likely to be homosexual, and at that time an ordinary family father could not leave the closet... There was no love in his life. I didn't see in my life my dad caress my mom, or her caress him, and that my mom was the most tender person in the world. But not with him. Obviously, how could I be tender to a man who insulted her, just like my sister, and who hit her? He created his own hell and didn't have the courage to divorce and let us go. It would have been fair for him to say: “I am creating a toxic family. I'm unhappy. I must go and leave these poor people alone.” At school, like Frankie, he was bullied, too?Not so much. But there was an extreme moment, which I deal with in the novel. When I kissed a girl when I was 13 and on Monday, when I got to school, a supercharismatic, nefarious, misogynistic, believed, and supernarcissistic guy invented that she had said that when I kissed her she felt like a banana eaten by a chango. He made a mockery of the year at school and destroyed my teenage years. A few years ago I learned that he had become a millionaire and presided over Trump's club of followers in Tampa. How long did it take him to get over it?I never dared kiss a girl again. My knees were shaking. I was convinced that it was really ugly and ridiculous, it made me a monster character of Kafka. When I got to college and some woman was blowing my mind, I thought she was setting me up. At first I didn't think I could be attractive. I had a hard time losing that horrible fear. What was I looking for writing Monkey Boy?I wanted to explore my roots and thought that to understand who I was I had to explore the relationship with my father. I thought that my whole life had been to flee from him, that hence the escape from the United States, to immerse myself in Latin America during the Central American wars, to live in Mexico, to marry only Mexicans, that everything was going to be the opposite of my father; but with the book I discovered that I did not run away from him, but that I walked the way to my mother, that I returned to his world, I returned to my mother's nest. Monkey Boy helped me find out that he wasn't my dad's son, but my mom's son. Even living under the shadow of my dad's violence and all her weaknesses, she remained a positive woman, and I identify with her. Besides, my mom was laughing. She and I always laugh a lot. My dad never laughed, he didn't even know how to laugh. “She had a wonderfully jovial laugh, sometimes silly, but my father laughed less. Instead, I sometimes howled and howled like pretending, imitating the happy animals of a barn.” Is there nothing about him in you?Yes, his scepticism towards the privileged people, very Bostonian working class; he mocked the nouveau riche, he did not like the vain. By the relevance of experience in his writing, would you say that he is a realistic writer?Yes and no. Yes in the raw material I use, but what I do are fictional novels, even fantastic. In Monkey Boy from the beginning I play with an illusion of realism, with that character who during a train trip narrates himself his own life almost chronologically. Who would do that? It's not realistic. And the last part is like a ghost tale: I did it with all intent, because I wanted to end up obviously breaking with the fourth wall of realism. And the ghost tale would complete the memory circle, because every memory needs phantom elements to function. Well seen. If you want, put it on and pretend I said it. García Márquez said he was writing to be loved by his friends. You?I write following an impulse that comes from within. And also so that my friends love me. Nothing makes me happier than when what I've written like the writers I admire, like Rachel Kushner, Lauren-Groff, Valeria Luiselli... Nobody does better than them now. The gringo men no longer write good books... or, I don't know, I don't like their books, maybe it's just that, that to my liking the best that has been written in America recently has been written by women. From the old days he loved Saul Bellow, Isaac Bashevis Singer, John Cheever. From Latin America to me, Roberto Bolaño has been important, I admire Alejandro Zambra, Yuri Herrera, César Aira. Although my two contemporary literary icons are Toni Morrison and Natalia Ginzburg, whom I adore as a saint. Why did she? She taught me everything. How he writes and where he comes from. She witnessed horrible things, the Nazis killed her husband, left her widowed with three little children, and writes from there, but without sentimentality, dignity and elegance, putting the traumas in place and at the same time leaving free spaces for creation. It inspires me a lot. After all he's been through in his life, the child abuse, the years of loneliness, the brutality he witnessed in the war, the death of Aura... isn't it a little incredible that he's arrived so well at this point, happy in Mexico City with his wife, Jovi, and his two daughters?Yes, it's very crazy. Sometimes I get the disturbing idea that I'm too happy and that it's something I still don't quite understand and I have to learn to work. But I also have my worries, like money, because with children you feel more pressure to have financial security; or age, I don't like being old, and there are so many books I want to create. No, I think I've finally been able to make good decisions and not always be so self-destructive. It was. Always. How did he manage it?The duel teaches you everything, there is nothing wiser and more instructive than a terrible duel that only you can get out of. And that's where you come out knowing better what you want, what you need and what things to run from. He dedicates the book to four women. Tell me first about your mother, Yolanda Molina. What am I gonna tell you, I loved her like crazy. She's one of my favorite people of all time and the most important of my life, no doubt. Your agent, mythical Amanda Binky Urban. It was key to this book. When I delivered the first draft to the publisher it was over 800 pages long and they were about to leave. They couldn't take me anymore. Besides, there was tension for things they wanted to censor. My agent knew that at that point the novel was a real mess, but I was convinced that there was a good play there, so he pushed me and I remade it until I had a whole new book. What did they want to censor?Things like Frankie's girlfriend wasn't 20 years younger than him or that the gays of the seventies, of the pre-AIDS times, didn't seem so overly uninhibited. Editorials think they're protecting the book from the complicated atmosphere we're in, but my fundamental position is that to write fiction you need total freedom and you don't have to confuse the awkward with the really offensive. I don't want to hurt or offend for free, I don't. So I stand up for what I write and ignore anyone who wants to limit me. That's what I did with my editor's suggestions. She was exemplary: she respected him and, in the end, even gave me the reason. Do you think political correctness harms the quality of literature?I think that in order not to get into trouble I should answer you self-censoring me [laughs]. It is perniciously ubiquitous in certain parts of the literary and university world in the United States. There is a new way of reading with the eagerness of a moral police, and life and people are complex, passionately complex, labyrinthine in their confusions, sometimes thorny or demonic, twisted, harmless or aggressively driven by desire, not always admirable, but sometimes noble in hidden aspects at first sight. Perhaps this is what you want to deal with in your fiction, and there will be many people who do not want to pay attention to such complexities, who are not willing to embrace ambiguities or laugh even uncomfortablely. They read in search of the pleasure of righteous indignation. Look, I think it's cool that someone dedicates their real life, even their writing, to being part of the advance of change, we all want society to progress in every way, and to me, with two little girls, this struggle haunts me; but I don't want political ethics to become a literary duty. Tell me about your daughters. Jojo is 10 years old and she's a beauty, she plays the piano, she's captain of her football team and they just won a championship. Azalea has four and is extraordinary, with an innate sense of humor and self-esteem that Jovi and I don't know where it comes from, because we grew up feeling marginalized, I a child of such insecure suburb and she coming from poverty, the first of her entire family to go to college and, as her father says, the first to cross the border with visa and passport. Jovi is an amazing person. In the last line of The Inner Circuit he wrote: “Jhoana Montes Hernández, mi Jovi, you are the resurrection and the light.” And it's still that, and, besides, my partner in the task of creating a family, the most asshole there is. Hard? Extenuating. How does Aura Estrada remain in her life?She is always present, and her literary values continue to inspire me. She was very talented. I think it's because of her that I've gotten so close to the writers. He says he doesn't want his daughters to grow up in America. Why?Because right now it is a country sunk in hatred, with an economic inequality that is a cancer, where the elites rise more and more, and to others, good luck, and in which it seems that the only important thing is what your identity is; everything is identity, identity of race, of gender, almost nobody speaks of class identity and that a handful of people control everything and the rest is in abandonment. I'm bored with this obsession with identity. This is part of Monkey Boy's narrative fabric. There is a moment when the narrator says “I want to be nothing, why can’t I be nothing?” I've always wanted it. Transcend identity. Yes, I have spent my life, especially as a child, having to explain to people that I am half Jewish and half Catholic, that at home we celebrated Christmas and Chanukah, things like that. Ridiculous! What is being half Catholic, believing in a Christ hanging only from one hand, one leg and half a log? No one's half nothing, you're entirely who you are. End and end. You're 100% Jewish, you're 100% Catholic, whatever you are, and the mania of dividing and tagging and cataloging is... is the fucking other people problem! [the problem of others]. Why did he title the book with a nickname that hurt him so much when he was little?Because it's the perfect title. I like Monkey Boy as a metaphor. It was ambiguous in my case, it could also be taken as something fun or even affectionate. If a black boy is called a monkey, he's going to know that that's racist, it can't be anything else; but someone like me, who is both Guatemalan mestizo-mulato and white Jew, doesn't know for sure if it's racism or if they really think it looks like a monkey. This is the mestizo condition, and many times I have felt that my experience bothers because it does not fit within the current discussions of identity, that I am something like ethnically incorrect and that it is better to pass from people like me. But, honestly, it frees me to have that fragmented identity. With the trilogy that closes Monkey Boy, Francisco Goldman considers his most autobiographical impulse satisfied. He now works on a story that will place in New Bedford, a port south of Boston with a large Guatemalan community and the place where Moby Dick begins, in his opinion the only novel worthy of the qualifier of great American novel. Precisely with a phrase from Melville’s classic he decided to open his last book: “Come on, you, monkey,” a harpooner said.","Francisco Goldman, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 2011 for his novel Say her name, has just published his third book.",NEU,0.6370952725410461
12-31-2022,"Libros para salvar el planeta
","Faced with the feeling of defeat in the face of the collapse, various authors propose solutions that go through both direct action and the search for symbolic elements that challenge the collective consciousness The choice of the term was not something premeditated, but rather something of the “burning of the moment”. And that to the hair came, of course, the choice of the word “burn”. The year was 2000 and Paul J. Crutzen, Nobel Prize in Chemistry of 1995, participated in a conference when someone brought up the expression “Holocene”, the denomination that receives the geological period that began just under 10,000 years ago, starting from the end of the last glaciation. Convinced that that voice referring to a relatively warm-temperature Earth in which Homo sapiens thrived was no longer useful to designate the world that inhabited, Crutzen resorted to a term that since then has not stopped winning wholes: “Now we live in the Anthropocene!” That is, the age of mastery of the human being. In these two decades long since the anecdote, that intuition has been consolidated as a palpable reality, an eventuality that—literally—can be seen and felt. We people had never exercised such a degree of influence and domination over the planet. We have consolidated ourselves as a force of nature with the ability to create, but perhaps, above all, in the spirit of destruction. And the world goes to hell. You just need to look out there, through the house window or through the window of the screen. This is reflected in the countless dystopias we consume in series and films, which we read in novels and which are broadcast on television 24 hours a day, including, with their patina of cheesy optimism, the stellar Christmas announcements. The resources are depleted, the climate is destabilized, the system is collapsing, civilization is breaking down. The outlook is as frightening as it is exhausting. Planting in the face of the feeling of impotence that produces such a flood of fatalities, numerous authors and researchers have gone out for solutions. Not only do they propose measures of direct action, but they also encourage the search for symbolic elements capable of challenging the collective consciousness. Here, a brief sample of entries from a dictionary of terms for the reconstruction of the planet collected from a selection of recent essays. Acceptance. After denial, anger, negotiation and depression, mourning, they say, reaches its definitive stage with acceptance. The alphabetical order, however, requires that this voice be placed not the last one, but the first one on the list. Seneca said that “the increases are slow growing, but the road to ruin is fast,” and now Professor Ugo Bardi points out to him in Before the Collapse (Catarata) that, since every outcome is inevitable, if you have to collapse, at least let’s do it right. Or, what is the same thing, that we accept reality and proceed to organize ourselves. Specialist in complex systems, the Italian researcher argues that, while the current crisis does not have to mean the end of the world, it could mean the end of the world as we know it. Among the few good news that Bardi carries is the idea that any collapse is followed by a rebound. But would this be possible, the author asks, “in a world exhausted, in terms of mineral resources, and subject to great damage to ecosystems”? The answer: “A civilization of complexity comparable to ours cannot exist without access to a comparable energy flow.” And some possible alternatives for comfort: renewables, silicon, space travel. From the starting point of a dwindling humanity (if not missing), Islas del Abandonación (Captain Swing), from Cal Flyn, opens another loophole to hope. Through the pages, the author travels to landscapes of disaster all over the world—from Chernobyl to Detroit, from mountains of debris in Scotland known as the Five Sisters to the rotting sea of Salton in California—where nature has been able to reborn in unexpected ways at times. Food. Our voracious hunger is leaving the planet in the bones. Just as we consume uncontrolled clothing, we have engaged in cheap but unsustainable food that is not only harmful to the environment, but also to health. In Sitopia (Captain Swing), architect Carolyn-Steel (author of Hungry Cities, where she highlights the crucial relationship of dependence between what we eat and where we live) argues that food “can be the most powerful means we have to think and act together to create a better world.” Not in vain, our lives depend, and very directly, on it. In her essay, the British author explores not only the political and social power of food, but also the options they offer to reconnect with others and with the environment. Other titles, like And Now What Do We Eat? (Peninsula), by former food industry worker Christophe Brusset, draw a detailed map of the supermarket corridors to find the most direct path to health and sustainability in the middle of a jungle populated with junk food. In a long time ago we ate animals (Destiny), anthropologist Roanne Van Voorst enters into a technological and exclusively vegan future, a philosophy of life that does not fail to gain followers since it not only pursues sustainability, but also health and respect for other sentient beings. Anticapitalism. It is not clear whether it was Fredric Jameson or Slavoj Žižek who first uttered that round phrase that says it is “easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism,” but the truth is that more and more authors are trying to refute it. The impossible aspiration of unlimited growth, destructive consumerism, unbridled precariousness and the inequality of colossal proportions... It is obvious that the system is straining its limits beyond reasonableness and so certifies an increasing number of books that bet on the search for substitutes for the current socio-economic model, to which journalist Naomi Klein has already accused with all luxury of proof in her monumental This changes everything (Planet) of having positioned itself as the number one enemy of the environment. Capitalism or the planet (Errata Naturae), by Frédéric Lordon, defends pragmatism against idealism and proposes a way out through alliance with other movements such as anti-racism. How to dynamite a pipeline (Errata Naturae), by Andreas Malm, interrelates environmental militancy with anti-capitalism and the fight against fossil fuels, which are largely responsible for the climate crisis. Detachment from possessions, comforts, and privileges will undoubtedly be a daunting task. In Learning to live and die in the Anthropocene (Errata Naturae), Roy Scranton reflects on what it means to pass through the end of an era and brings out what philosophy—from stoic thought to humanism that connects us with others—can contribute to free us from our dependencies. The Ecology of Freedom (Captain Swing), by Murray Bookchin, advocates replacing the hierarchical structures of capitalism with horizontal organization. And in The Nature Against Capital (Bellaterra), Kohei Saito argues that the anti-ecologism that Marx has traditionally been accused of for his aspiration to continuous growth is in fact the result of a misunderstanding. On the contrary, the author stresses, the protection of the environment beats at the heart of the alternative proposed by socialism. Art. The list of calamities overflying the planet is extensive, and the ability of art to take sides, reduced. Or maybe not so much? Beyond the wake-up calls of various environmental groups based on spilling liquids on paintings, the French critic and curator Paul Ardenne exhibits in An ecological art. Plastic Creation and Anthropocene (Adriana Hidalgo) a compendium of creations that, while not offering solutions in terms of concrete effectiveness, do exert an influence in the sphere of symbolic. The artivists, as the activist artists were baptized, transport their ecological commitment to the field of representation. They produce material from ideas. And those notions are transmitted through his works to make the leap to reality. Concrete examples? The book brings dozens of case studies: it begins with classics such as Robert Smithson's Land Art sculptures and Joseph Beuys' environmental performances in the 20th century and moves towards contemporary proposals such as Olafur Eliasson's awareness projects and Jérémy Gobé's biomimetic corals. Awareness. Despite the unanimity of scientific arguments, there is still a huge burden of disinformation around the global ecological crisis. So much so that there are even those who deny it, not to mention the many others who ignore it, or ignore it. In Colapsology (Arpa), French researchers Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens took stock of catastrophes and updated solutions, shaping a book that became a sort of introductory manual, a starting point from which to address the dangerous issue of cataclysm. Later, the authors joined biologist Gaultier Chapelle in Another End of the World is possible (Arpa), where from the basis of collapse, i.e., the study of collapse, they broaden the outlook for collapse, a philosophy of collapse capable of propelling optimism in the face of the feeling of defeat. Your recipe: realizable answers to difficult questions, such as the search for meaning in a declining world, the relevance of moving forward, and the need to create bonds to combat selfishness. Decretion. If we add finite resources to the desire for inexhaustible expansion, there is no way to square the accounts. The solution? Subtract. In Decretion. A reasoned proposal (Alianza), the former university professor Carlos Taibo starts from an image that invites to reposition the scales: in Spain, he explains, the ecological footprint is above 3, which means that “to maintain the existing economic activities it is necessary to have a territory at least three times greater than that available”. After more than a decade of study and dissemination, the author gathers and justifies the conclusions he has reached on what really implies to decrease and why it is inescapable to get to work. Taibo, defender of anarchism and self-management, has an even more recent title, Ecofascism (Catarata), where he warns of the commitment to ecology that comes from the side of certain powerful, who, aware of the serious crisis that is going through the planet, strive to preserve resources, but only for the enjoyment of a few. Spirituality. Since René Descartes bequeathed to posterity his well-known “Cogito, ergo sum”, European thought and, with it, the global has been dragged by the implicit belief that only reason and logic govern the universe. Intuition and mysticism have been relegated to the realm of superstory, but more and more voices are rising up against the tyranny of mathematics. Princess of Asturias Award of Social Sciences 2017, the British Karen Armstrong has translated into Sacred Nature (Critic) an enlightening claim to regain the link with the natural world. Expert in religions (she was a nun for seven years), she concentrates on Chinese and Indian traditions as exponents of a philosophical current that not only respects but venerates nature. “It’s not about believing or not believing in this or that religious doctrine,” he says, “but about incorporating into our lives a series of perceptions and practices that have the right potential to transform our minds and hearts.” In Ecotopia (Anagrama), the author, art historian and yoga teacher Alexis Racionero Rague travels through the flow of schools, myths and authors ——from shamanism to utopian socialism; from the Walker before a sea of fog, from Friedrich, who marvels at the immensity of the landscape, to the comforting asceticism of the Walden of Thoreau — to lead to a founding decalogue of ecotopia, a utopia beyond ecology that allows us to “connect more deeply with the wisdom of the Earth to establish a new relationship with it”. And in Essential Nature (Atalanta), the philosopher Christian of Quincey recalls that the notion of a living universe, of “intrinsically sentient matter”, has been a continuum throughout the history of Western thought, only recently interrupted. The lack of consideration for the world that nourishes and envelops us, sums up the thinker, is but an anomaly of our time. Reorganization. A few years ago, the late biologist Edward O. Wilson — nicknamed the “father of biodiversity” — launched an extreme proposal to reverse the extinction of animal and plant species: to reduce human presence to half the planet, leaving the other half available to nature. After that theory, a call to open our eyes presented in the book Middle Planet (Errata Naturae), other authors have continued to raise ideas on how to organize ourselves, many certainly less daring, but perhaps more feasible, at least in the short term. From an official pragmatism, with information gathered from surveys, interviews and research, ex-adviser of Obama Beth Simone Noveck has developed in How to Solve Public Problems (Galaxia Gutenberg) a catalogue of measures to reconfigure the public square of democracy with the help of social networks and digital technology. Within its 2030 City collection, the Catarata publishing house offers in titles such as circular, cohesive and creative Cities, edited by María Jesús Monteagudo, Nerea Aranbarri and Basagaitz Guereño, reflections on how cities can contribute to sustainable human development through the promotion of recycling, autonomy and the empowerment of talent. Mental health. We need to talk about “this-that-us-is-going.” Surely many will not be able to define it accurately, it is a gray heaviness that is sometimes perceived as a black cloud or a white noise. But there he is, always stalking. Undefined malaise, associated with precarious mental health, from which today few, almost no one, can escape. If there were not enough reasons for concern in this late-capitalist society, now comes the eco-anxiety—the anguish at the imminence of cataclysm—to sneak into our heads. In And Now I What I Do (Captain Swing), Andreu Escrivà applies, without sermons, the maxim that affirms that change begins with oneself. In order to overcome the crisis, the author urges us to take action on the matter. Among the commandments he proposes to address the climate emergency and, by the way, to improve our psychological well-being are ideas as basic and necessary as dismantling the excuses with which we justify our passivity. In parallel, the ambientologist develops a decalogue of imperatives, with actions ranging from the “run” and the “exige” to the “imagina” and, above all, the “we do”.

12-31-2022,"Las ‘bestas’ de San Francisco: el millonario que encerró la casa de su vecino en una verja de 13 metros de altura
","The numantine resistance of a humble inhabitant in a Californian neighborhood of new rich people curbed, in 1876, the real estate plans of tycoon Charles Crocker, who, after several attempts to demotivate his rival, decided to surround his house with a wooden fence Fear of neighbor and other nearby predators is not out of fashion: there is As bestas, nominated for 17 Goya Awards and inspired by real events, which deals exactly with this topic. But there is another case, earlier and further away, in which this fear was translated into architectural delirium. The story begins with Nicholas Yung, a man who in 1876 got involved in the real estate plans of tycoon Charles Crocker. Born in Germany, Yung had migrated in 1848 to the United States in search of opportunities. And he found them. After years of effort and hard work, he gathered enough wealth to start one of those businesses in San Francisco that always have a future: a funeral home. Thanks to her, she was able to move along with his wife Roseta to a small parkelite on top of California Street Hill (at the intersection with Powell Street), where a little house with a garden was built that also had enviable views, with the Golden Gate to the north, San Francisco Bay to the east and the city to the south. So attractive was that area that soon more wealthy people would be interested in it. Charles Crocker (1822 – 1888) had made his fortune at the expense of foreign labor and very cheap, as one of the four major investors in the railway giant Central Pacific Railroad, when the trains were to be the next major American industry. After that, his partners and he thought that a good place to build the most exclusive homes of San Francisco was that hill, because of its panorama, the tranquility it offered, the proximity to the financial city and the connection they planned to carry out with the installation of a cable car. Former Republican Governor Leland Stanford moved there, as would railway entrepreneur Mark Hopkins, Jr. In a show of power, Crocker became an even higher mansion on the hill, nearly 23 metres high and over a thousand square meters wide. Right past the Yung. The neighborhood began to be known as Nob Hill, translated as “the hill of the rich” (nob, in Anglo-Saxon jargon, means “rich and distinguished person”). For the installation of all these ostentatious homes, Crocker and his associates had not found too much resistance from the former residents, but in the northeast corner of their own block, the businessman, who had acquired 12 plots of 13, came up with an unexpected enemy. Yung's house was ridiculous in comparison to those gigantic buildings rising around him. Their views were no longer so good because of them, to begin with. And Crocker, as a tycoon and manager of an exclusive neighborhood, also didn't like a working-class family ruining the incomparable framework that lay before him. He offered $3,000 (with inflation, the equivalent of more than $83,000 today; that is, more than €78,000) to Yung to leave, like his former neighbours. But it wasn't going to be that simple. And it's not that Yung was any anti-gentrification activist: he simply heard that Crocker had paid someone else the devastating $25,000 figure for the land of his house, so he aspired to a better offer. The negotiation was gradually gaining ground. Crocker went up to $6,000 first and 9,000 later, but the lucrative precedent, which was perhaps a rumor or perhaps true, had convinced the funeral home man that he should stand firm. According to newspapers of the time, Yung announced that he would settle – in the broad sense of the term – for 12,000 dollars. The figure was affordable for Charles Crocker, but not for his pride. Disturbed by a humble immigrant beating his pulse, the tycoon raised his tone: he instructed his workers to drive the debris resulting from the dynamite they were detonating to level the hill to the Yung house. That did not work, and Crocker increased hostilities by investing $3,000 (the amount he did not want to add to his last offer) in installing a wooden fence of nearly 13 meters high to cover the family's home. The installation of a fence erected with the unique purpose of enervating a neighbor (which has its own concept, spite fence or spite wall, something like “wall of contempt”) is currently punishable by law, but not in 19th century California, to the misfortune of Nicholas Yung and his own, who should have gotten used to living in darkness, without the views or fresh air of that home of their dreams that had acquired time. The crazy montage became a real tourist attraction thanks to the cable car, just as the Numantine resistance of Yung, who did not have a hard time winning public opinion, acquired rank as a symbol of the struggle between the man on foot and the voracious capitalist machinery. The San Francisco Chronicle newspaper referred to the wall as a “crime” and a “monument to evil.” From the pages of that same diary, Yung picked up the glove and challenged his rich neighbor to build a higher wall: according to him, his plan was to place on top of his house a flag with skulls and bones next to a giant coffin, as an announcement for his funeral home and also as a reminder of the death that would frighten the neighborhood's millionaires. He does not know that Yung fulfilled his threat, but in 1880 he made his own the warning about the fleetingness of life and died. The story, however, was far from over: Roseta, his widow and accomplice in this quixotic struggle, did not want to sell either. Charles Crocker would die eight years later without seeing his wishes fulfilled. Mrs Yung would also reject offers from a Chinese laundry and an advertising company. Unfortunately, she would not live to see the wall removed despite her appeals to the City Council, as there was no specific legislation. Upon his death in 1902, The San Francisco Chronicle dedicated an editorial to Crocker’s heirs for “preserving the witness of spite” of the millionaire and maintaining his “legado of hatred,” rather than overthrowing him. The children of the marriage, however, quickly understood the Crocker family and sold the land for an undisclosed amount. The wall of contempt fell in 1905... as the whole new property would fall a year later, with the famous San Francisco earthquake, between 7.5 and 8 degrees on the Richter scale, which left at least 10,000 dead. After the fateful event, the space was donated to charity and on it currently stands the Episcopal Church Grace Cathedral. The temple is recognized, among other reasons, for having hosted one of the speeches of Martin Luther King, a religious concert of Duke Ellington or having served as a stage in films such as Bullitt (1968), The plot (1975), The Bicentennial Man (1999), My name is Harvey Milk (2008) or Venom: There will be slaughter (2022). Beginning in 1956, the State of California enacted a law that definitively prohibited the installation of walls of contempt; that is, without greater function than that of removing views of a neighbor to bother him, in harmony with most states of the country, which limit them to a maximum of 6 feet (1.83 meters). This has not been an obstacle, it has been redundant, for other citizens to explore creative ways to annoy others. Also in California, justice had to intervene to rule that planting tall trees at the edge of a property was considered another form of wall of contempt, after a resident of California responded to the reform that a neighbor had made in his home to see the mountain. In 2008, a Utah farmer placed three old cars upright as a fence between his livestock farm and the neighbors, who, according to him, had complained about flies and dust, but were not in favour of installing a fence (half-paying) because they liked to see his garden, horses and cattle. The farmer called his work Redneck Stonehenge, referring to the famous megalithic monument of the United Kingdom and the conservative Southerners (rednecks), although he stated that his intention was only to remind the new inhabitants of the area that that was the field and that the cars would not stay there permanently. History shows that the walls of contempt can also rise for oneself: such was the teaching of the Irishman Robert Rochfort, Count of Belvedere, who in the 18th century built the today known as the Wall of Jealouses in the city of Mullingar in order not to see the huge mansion that his brother George (suspected, for more inri, had he slept with his wife) had been built in front of his house.

12-31-2022,"El mundo mira de nuevo a China con temor tres años después del inicio de la pandemia
","The abrupt change in strategy by the Chinese authorities and their opacity have raised concerns about mutations that escape vaccines. For now, the cases coming from the Asian country are already known variants in Europe Three years of pandemic and more than 15 million deaths have left the world with very painful lessons. One of the first was that the only way to fight the coronavirus without vaccines was through relentless confinement. Governments later learned that any return to normalcy would go through careful monitoring of the incidence as the first doses began to immunize the population. A year ago, the omicron variant, the most contagious virus in history, arrived, becoming something like a dose of natural memory for hundreds of millions of people. The number of contagions was so large that it was impossible to count, but this was already losing importance in the face of the great reduction of serious cases thanks to the protection achieved. And now, when they thought they had the whole agenda studied, Western countries find themselves looking again at China, trying to interpret the few facts available and wondering if they are facing one of the last pandemic hives or in a high-risk situation that can send them back to the check-out box. “There is concern about the evolution of contagions in China, as well as about the difficulty of making a proper assessment of the situation given the limited information currently available to us.” With these words, the Minister of Health, Carolina Darias, summarized the uncertainty that exists this Friday. The Spanish government is, after Italy, the second European to impose border controls — negative diagnostic test or vaccine certificate — on travellers from China, which has also been done by the United States and several Asian countries. The measure, however, is born with controversy. While several communities have asked Health to tighten it, rejecting Chinese vaccine certificates for the less effective serums used in the country and testing all travellers, most European countries reject it for now. “They are not needed yet,” said German Health Minister Karl Lauerbach. The reason given is that the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) has also pointed out this Friday: the variants circulating in China are the same already in Europe and therefore “do not pose a threat” to the population of the continent. The first flight to be controlled by the government is scheduled to land in Madrid at six o'clock this Saturday afternoon. According to Sanidad, “passes from the Asian country will be able to pass through a documentary, visual and temperature control, in addition to carrying out a diagnostic test of active infection by SARS-CoV-2, at the point of entry to Spain”. “From the epidemiological point of view, when the circulation of the virus is already high as it is now, it doesn’t make much sense to reduce the number of cases entering a country if the variants are going to be the same. The key is to quickly detect if new forms of the virus arise, because then you can change everything,” says Miguel Hernán, professor of epidemiology at Harvard University. The need to strengthen surveillance through genetic sequencing, testing for new variants of the virus, has been the most repeated message by the European Commission in the last two days. This, however, should not necessarily involve testing newcomers from China, but is based on the systematic screening of a sample of positive cases detected in a particular area. Juan Carlos Galán, head of Virology at the Hospital Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, says that according to the latest tests, “nothing makes us think about new mutations or [in which] the risk of vaccine escape has increased.” The fear that new variants will emerge has been triggered by some figures that give an idea of the gigantic wave of new contagions that China suffers after the end of the restrictions. As Bloomberg advanced, citing data handled by Chinese health authorities, nearly 250 million people would have been infected in the country in the first three weeks of December, 37 million in a single day, on the 20th. “They are huge numbers and it is true that whenever there are more contagions, the number of mutations increases and, therefore, the risk of new variants arising. But it is also not so different from what has been happening in the United States and other countries where it has been allowed to circulate without many restrictions to the virus,” says Quique Bassat, ICREA researcher at the ISGlobal Institute (Barcelona). Pedro Gullón, professor of public health at the University of Alcalá, adds: “It is never positive that there are very high transmissions somewhere in the world, because of the impact it will have on the local population and the risk of new variants, but in a global situation of community circulation of the virus I am not very clear about the real risk that this entails.” Experts do agree that the alert situation should serve to boost the administration of booster doses among the Spanish population, which has been lagging behind in recent weeks with regard to the coverage initially achieved. According to the data of the Ministry of Health published on Friday, 73% of the population over 80 years of age has already received the fourth puncture, a percentage that is reduced to 62% among those aged 70 to 79 and to 41% among the sexogenarians. This second dose is updated to protect against the variant omicron in addition to the original form of the virus. In any case, even with the coverage already achieved, experts believe that the epidemiological situation should not change too much in Spain in the coming weeks if new variants do not emerge. In fact, according to Friday Darias, the situation of new cases among the supervised population (over 60 years) is of “stability and even a slight decrease”. “What has precipitated what is happening has been the abrupt end of the restrictions applied by China, but it was something that was going to happen in any case faster or slower. Omicron is so contagious that once it has entered a country you cannot stop it without virtually total confinement. What China has not really managed to do well has been to achieve adequate vaccination coverage among its population. This is what now triggers the risk of serious cases and deaths. Spain and the developed countries are not in this situation,” says Miguel Hernán. Only 69.8% of those over 60 years of age in China have received the booster dose of the vaccine, which is reduced to 42.4% in those over 80 years of age. In addition, the two serums used in the country, Sinovac and Sinopharm, have proved less effective than those used in Western countries or Russia. The need to resort to constant local confinements and the obligation to subject the population to virtually daily PCR tests due to the constant outbreaks caused by the high contagion of the Omicron variant is one of the reasons why the population was fed up with the incidents that led the Chinese authorities a month ago to put the restrictions suddenly behind them. It is an example, like the low coverage achieved, of the complex relationship between science and politics that has ended up weakening the response to the pandemic in countries like China, according to Fernando García Benavides, professor of Public Health at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona). “When a country allows free public debate, this often leads to the modification and improvement of measures taken that lead to unwanted results. In democracy, this is a gradual process that institutions manage to articulate properly. China, on the other hand, has not been able to do so. This has prevented him from adopting changes on the fly and has ended up applying them when the situation was already unsustainable, with flocks that in turn have caused other problems,” concludes this researcher.",Spain is the latest European country to impose border controls on travellers from China because of the spread of the SARS-Co virus.,NEU,0.517605185508728
12-31-2022,"El Congreso estadounidense publica las declaraciones de impuestos de Trump que el expresidente rechazó divulgar
","The tycoon paid $1.1 million in federal taxes in his first three years as president, and no tax in 2020 In discount time, days before the House of Representatives passes into the hands of Republicans, a Democratic-controlled commission has released the tax returns for six years of former President Donald Trump. The publication of the records, edited, puts an end to a long legal battle waged by the Republican to prevent them from seeing the light, but not to the controversy surrounding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), unable to accurately scrutinize the tycoon's turnover while in office. The revelation adds another bucket to Trump's record after announcing his intention to run for election in 2024. According to data released this Friday, Trump paid $1.1 million (just over a million euros) in federal income taxes in his first three years as president, and nothing in 2020, when his income began to decline. Once he arrived at the White House, the tycoon gave his older children the reins of the family emporium, the Trump Organization, which, according to records, had a adjusted gross income of $15.8 million in his first three years as president. In the two years prior to his arrival in the White House, the Republican recorded large business losses, as shown by the records of fiscal years between 2015 and 2020. The ex-mandator has attacked the Democrats and the Supreme Court with a message on their social network, Truth Social. “The Democrats should never have done it. The Supreme Court should never have approved it, and it's going to lead to horrible things for a lot of people. The great division of the United States is going to be much worse,” Trump said. “Tax returns show once again how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use amortization and other tax deductions as an incentive to create thousands of jobs and magnificent businesses,” he added. Until the decision of the Supreme Court, which last month postulated the delivery of Trump's declarations from 2015 to 2020, the work of the House Media and Arbitrian Committee, chaired by Democrat Richard Neal, had been a continuous setback since 2019. The Republican went through all possible instances judicially to prevent them from seeing the light, with arguments as peregrine as that the business dimension of his real estate emporium prevented him from evaluating and accounting for them. Similar argument was used to explain the IRS' myopia, which could not fully audit him during his term of office, despite the fact that the committee passed a law that would force the Treasury to complete the face-to-face audits within 90 days of taking office. “A president is not an ordinary taxpayer. It has power and influence unlike any other American citizen. That great power implies even greater responsibility,” declared Richard Neal in a statement. After coming out of two impeachments to which he was subjected by the 76-year-old House of Representatives, Donald Trump faces a complicated legal offensive that can tarnish his political future or, conversely, give wings to his most extremist supporters. The congressional committee that investigated the assault on the Capitol has asked to prosecute Trump for four crimes, including obstruction of justice and insurrection. The FBI seized confidential documents that the Republican had taken from the White House, and two ongoing investigations in New York City, one of a civil and one of a criminal nature, analyse his business for alleged tax fraud. The House Media and Arbitrians committee requested the statements in 2019, arguing that Congress needed them to evaluate the IRS' audit of presidents' tax returns, a purpose Republicans considered to be politically motivated. Trump, who took office in January 2017, was the first presidential candidate since the 1970s not to make his taxes public. He sued the committee to try to keep them private, but the high court, with a conservative majority, ruled against them. In 2016, when he was still a candidate for the presidency, the tycoon pointed out the scale and complexity of his finances as a reason to challenge the tradition, followed by all candidates to occupy the White House, of religiously publishing his tax returns. “They’re not like a normal tax return,” he said in a TV interview. Over the next seven years, the Republican has also resisted making them public, first, he said, by an “invasive” IRS audit motivated precisely by his refusal to publish them; then, since 2019, in response to the House Committee’s initiative. Records show that Trump's revenue and fiscal obligations fluctuated dramatically from 2015 to 2020, during his presidential campaign and subsequent term. They show that Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, benefited from large deductions, claimed losses, and paid few or no income tax in part of that period. In 2016, the year he won the election, and 2017, the first in the White House, the Republican paid $750 in federal taxes, according to a 20-year investigation of fiscal information published by The New York Times in September 2020, two months before the election. The exclusive showed that she had not paid income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years, largely because from 2011 to 2018 she declared losing more money than she had.

12-31-2022,"Lula regresa al poder para reescribir su legado
","The leftist will take possession of a third term in Brazil this Sunday, New Year, after defeating Bolsonaro When on New Year 2019 Jair Messias Bolsonaro arrived in a Rolls Royce convertible at the ceremony, in Brasilia, to be named president, the first far-right in the history of Brazil, the man who will succeed him this Sunday, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was imprisoned for corruption in a police station, not in a prison, in his capacity as former head of state. Lula read books like never before in life, exchanged a daily letter with his girlfriend (today wife), who sent him marmites with homemade food, exercised, and designed with lawyers and his closest collaborators a political return that then sounded like delirium: because of his age — he is 77 years old — and because of the ristra of judicial cases that he had pending. He never stopped proclaiming his confidence in Brazilian institutions and that he was the victim of persecution. When he receives the presidential girdle in front of Planalto's modernist and glazed palace this Sunday, a surprising political resurrection will culminate. He returns to rewrite his legacy, with the mission of rebuilding social policies and democracy after Bolsonaro, with the dream of being remembered inside and outside his country as the Lula of glorious times, not that of judicial odyssey. The ceremony of 1 January will also be the anniversary of the extraordinary moment that Lula starred in 20 years ago, when he became the first worker—and first leftist—to come to power in an unequal and classist country where, in some privileged neighborhoods, employees are still relegated to use elevators different from those of their employers. During the 2003 New Year Lula announced that his great mission as president would be for every Brazilian to have breakfast, eat and dine every day. For a time it was, but with the pandemic the hunger returned. Today there are more than 33 million Brazilians who do not know if they will dine tonight or have breakfast tomorrow. Combating hunger and poverty will be the priorities of the new president, together with the economic revival and the strengthening of democracy. “We need to create jobs, pay wages, distribute income and make people suffer less than they have been suffering,” the president-elect announced this Thursday in Brasilia, presenting the last names of his Cabinet. He ardently defends that the poor also have the right to enjoy the pleasures of life and to be happy. For this campaign he reformulated the slogan “hope will overcome fear” of 2002, as “love will overcome hatred”. Take over from former military officer Bolsonaro, a president who has not recognized Lula's victory, the hardest in history (almost two million votes, 1.8 points). He will assume power in a very polarized environment in which even the ghost of terrorism has appeared with a failed attack by a bagganarist. Bolsonaro himself condemned this action on Thursday. In addition to bombs, what was never seen in this country, Brazil was shaken two months ago by radical groups who camped in barracks throughout the country convinced that they had been robbed of the elections and calling on the military to put order, as in 1964. This order translates into asking Lula to be prevented from returning to the presidency so that, they say, “Brazil is not a communist country, a Venezuela.” In the 2003 New Year, Lula, as president, was a great unknown, a hopeful promise. After being defeated three times in the presidential elections, he reached the top of power with a loose victory. All of Brazil, except one state (Alagoas), dyed the red of the Workers' Party (PT). He was a person of the dream of the dispossessed masses and the fears of the markets, which he tried to appease. Now the country is divided into two halves. The north is Lula red, the south is purse blue. And the outgoing president's allies dominate Congress, although in both Houses everything is negotiable. It varies the price. In these two decades, Brazilian society has turned to the right, evangelicals gain space in society, politics, the music industry and the Supreme Court. And the winds of the economy, which blew in favor of Lula in his first two terms, are now blowing against him. The negationist and inhuman management of the pandemic sank Bolsonaro, who was elected to save Brazil from the corruption and evils of the PT. That, coupled with their strategy of attacks on democracy and institutions, turned Lula, who four years ago was a political corpse and one of the most hated guys in Brazil, into the desired solution to close a dark stage. Hatred of the Workers' Party evaporated, red PT stopped being banned on the streets. And when it became clear that the election would be a hand in hand between Lula and Bolsonaro with clear advantage for the former, economic power laid hands on pragmatism and recalled how well things went with him in the Presidency. With the skills of negotiator and strategist that even his enemies recognize him, Lula managed to get opponents of the entire ideological spectrum to join his leadership in cutting off the ultra-right and to dry up the authoritarian drift. As he said in the victory speech, “this is not a victory for Lula or the PT.” The challenge is huge. And expectations are on par. The Brazilian economy has not grown for a decade, the budget limits are narrow, false news and misinformation have seriously damaged the credibility of the institutions and satisfy the disparate partners that have put him up to power will require gifts of fine alchemist. Although the transition has taken a long time despite the noise of the Bolsonaro's own Bolsonaro's supporters calling for a coup d'état, Lula has suffered to form the Cabinet and distribute portfolios, power and budget among his allies. And that had 37 ministries to offer. But the really strategic ministries have left them in the hands of veterans of their party. And in economics he has gotten away with it despite the suspicions of the elites. He has entrusted economic policy to faithful Fernando Haddad, the man who agreed to replace him as a candidate for the PT four years ago when he was in prison. He has suffered to square the puzzle of the ministries. He announced the last names three days after the opening term. He'll rule with nine games. The Lula who will premiere 2023 inaugurating his third presidential term, obviously, is also different from that of 2003. She has government experience, she has gone through having appointed a successor, Dilma Roussef, who was dismissed on August 31, 2016 in the midst of a great wave of popular discontent. And he himself knows what it's like to fall into disgrace and spend 580 days in jail for corruption that in 2018 drove him away from the presidential race. The court cases against him were undone like a sugarcane because the judge who imprisoned him, now Senator Sérgio Moro—that's the plot in Brazilian soap operas—was not impartial. Lula led the wave of the Latin American left at the beginning of the 21st century, bringing the longings of the poor, and the aspirations of Brazil and the Global South, to the conclaves of the most powerful. She's over cancer. His story captivated his compatriots. And the world. He left the presidency with a higher popularity of 87%. As the Brazilian Constitution prohibits a third consecutive term, he embarked on an international career as a retired politician who had to leave when the judicial problems piled up. He's widowed. The New Year's Day will be well covered by the international community with almost twenty heads of state, including the king of Spain, Felipe VI, who already attended his other two inaugurations, the presidents of Argentina, Colombia, Chile or Portugal. The Spanish delegation also includes Vice-President Yolanda Díaz, and Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares. It is unknown who will hand over the presidential girdle, but Bolsonaro is ruled out. The ultra-rightist will live the end of his term thousands of miles from Brasilia, Florida. This Friday he flew to Trump lands after giving his last speech as head of state. Your successor just wants you to keep it quiet. “Let the one who lost the election be quiet. Whoever won has the right to hold a great popular party,” he said on Thursday. Shortly before he had reminded his future ministers to prepare themselves because he likes to work a lot and do many things at the same time and they are all younger than him.

12-31-2022,"De la merma del poder autonómico a la defensa de la unidad de España: nueve años de Constitucional de mayoría conservadora
","The court parked the debate on the abortion law, endorsed cuts in the rights of the PP governments, curbed the independence challenge and limited the legislative capacity of the communities.The Constitutional Court has dictated in its rulings the recent history of Spain. The guarantee body, dominated over the last nine years by a majority of judges elected on the PP's proposal, has in this time erected a wall of orders and judgments — the majority, unanimously — in the face of attempts to break up the Catalan Generalitat. On the other hand, its resolutions have transformed a country where today it is constitutional to reject a migrant on the border without providing him with a lawyer to defend him, or it is legal to subsidize with public funds schools that discriminate by sex because “the system of differentiated education is a pedagogical option that cannot be considered discriminatory”. Any citizen can end up in jail for burning a flag of Spain or getting rid of the prison even if he makes jokes about terrorism, according to the varied interpretation of the Constitution made by the court at this time. The last fiscal amnesty of the PP Government was declared unconstitutional without consequences for the amnesties. The court also endorsed the reviewable permanent prison (the hardest punishment in the reform of the Penal Code), because it is not “neither inhuman nor degrading,” and removing the health card from immigrants who do not have a residence permit in Spain, one of the cuts approved by the government of Mariano Rajoy during the economic crisis. Nine years of sentences also show how the votes of the conservative majority allowed some autonomous laws to be annulled for lack of competence while the progressive minority signed particular complaints about the “restrictive interpretation” of the Basic Law. Four Parliaments (Navarra, La Rioja, Cantabria and Catalonia) passed laws in 2015 and 2016 prohibiting fracking in their territories; no one could do business breaking the subsoil with the intention of obtaining gas. The Constitutional Court annulled these rules because the measure exceeded the autonomous powers and could only be approved by the central administration. Five years later, the Courts voted in favour of the Climate Change Law that prompted the government of the nation to, among other measures, turn fracking into an illegal activity in Spain. Baleares wanted to ban bullfighting and its Autonomous Chamber supported a regulation that prevented the death of an animal in the square. But the Constitutional Court considered that this law could not be applied because it “disturbed or undermined State jurisdiction over intangible cultural heritage”. Catalonia did the same thing as the Balearics with the same result. In this case there was no state law that made possible what proved impossible for these communities. The Constitutional Court annulled these and other autonomous laws with one single argument: it is prohibited to prohibit issues within the competence of the State. In these judgments there were particular votes of progressive magistrates who warned of the perverse effect of these pronouncements: “The autonomous state is being eroded or the communities are being reduced by the restrictive interpretation of the Constitution made by the court,” said some of those votes. The 12 members of the Constitutional plenum, supposed sages of law selected in universities or in high judicial bodies by the two parties—PSOE and PP—that have distributed 40 years of power in Spain, resolved on all sorts of issues: from threats to the unity of a country to the sense of the hurtful and ironic verses of a rapper sentenced to prison. The court responsible for ensuring respect for the Constitution, interpreting the Basic Law and delivering the best justice has handed down 1,935 decisions in the last nine years with a conservative majority. Of these, 473 were censored by individual votes, the symbol of the discrepancy between judges. The last conservative mandate in the Constitutional Court (2013-2022) coincided with the beginning of the pro-independence attempt in Catalonia (the first illegal consultation took place in November 2014); with the development of that illegal challenge (the prohibited referendum was held on October 1, 2017 and then the frustrated declaration of independence was made); and with the end of the adventure that led its promoters to jail (conviction sentence of November 2019). In almost all these episodes, the Constitutional had a major role to play in curbing the unconstitutional independence process in Catalonia and upholding the legality of the trial and subsequently condemning those involved. Between 2014 and 2022, two dozen sentences and orders were passed with almost unanimous support to defend the unity of Spain by censoring the independence plans, implemented through resolutions and laws of the Parliament that the Constitutional Court was suspending and then nullifying. Individual votes (up to three progressive magistrates came together in some sentences) questioned the Supreme's convictions of independence leaders as “disproportionate” or rejected the preventive detention measure applied to Oriol Junqueras. Once the secessionist attempt was suffocated, some of its promoters convicted and imprisoned, the court tried to reject dozens of resources from the independence leaders. The alarm decree 463/2020 of March 14 imposed the lock in Spain to stop the contagions by coronavirus. The Constitutional Court was divided into two after intense discussions that ended with the declaration of unconstitutionality of the article imposing house confinement on the entire population. Most considered that the appropriate normative instrument for such a restrictive measure was a state of emergency rather than a state of alarm. The ruling, which supported five conservative magistrates and a judge elected at the time on the proposal of the PSOE, was a standoff to the government of Pedro Sánchez but without any effect on the citizens, since the decree of alarm was not in force when the Constitutional passed its ruling. The court considered that the measures taken were necessary, but considered that the legal vehicle used to impose them was incorrect. Two other judgements overturned several aspects of other decrees related to measures against the pandemic. The Citizen Security Act adopted by the Government of Mariano Rajoy, known as the gag law, was appealed on the grounds that fundamental human rights were violated. Among these rights, the remedy highlighted that of migrants who set foot in Spanish territory and are returned without guarantees. The Constitutional, in a confused pronouncement supported by the conservative majority, thus endorsed the hot returns: “The rejection will be carried out in compliance with international human rights and protection standards to which Spain is a party. The material action shall be constitutional without prejudice to the judicial control that may be exercised by virtue of the actions and remedies brought in each case by the foreign person.” This constitutional argument is now used by the Ministry of the Interior and the Attorney General ' s Office to defend the legality of the rejections at the border that have been documented in recent months. Some sentences, such as the one that eliminated the prison sentence for Cesar Strawberry, advanced in protecting the right to freedom of expression. The speaker for that ruling was progressive magistrate Juan Antonio Xiol, who argued against the one-year prison sentence that the Supreme had imposed on Def's musical leader with Dos for six tweets where he ironized with the return of the Grapos and Eta or the attempt that cost Carrero Blanco his life. However, another sentence, supported by six of the seven judges of the conservative group, kept a trade unionist who promoted the burning of a Spanish flag in prison. The sentence argued that outrages against the flag of Spain are not protected by freedom of expression. The Constitutional also overturned very critical pronouncements with King Philip VI by the Catalan Parliament. The PP elected former deputy Andrés Ollero, declared anti-abortionist, as a judge for the Constitutional Court in 2012, only two years after Congress passed the abortion deadline law. This rule replaced the one adopted in 1985, which allowed the termination of pregnancy only in the event of a serious risk to the physical or mental health of the mother, rape or malformations in the foetus. With the law passed in 2010, abortion would be free during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Ollero was given the presentation of the sentence on this abortion deadline law that his own party had appealed to. For years, the presidents of the Constitutional Council decided “out of prudence” to put that sentence in a drawer because the ruling then, the PP, had promised to reform the law to solve the problems of constitutionality that it had. But in 2017, when Rajoy had already decided not to change the paragraphs that the PP had appealed in the time-limit law, the Constitutional was renewed and Ollero aspired to preside over it. This judge says that socialist leader Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba pressured the Rajoy government to prevent this possibility on the grounds that the abortion law would then be declared unconstitutional. The case is that Ollero was never president of the Constitutional and the PP's appeal against that rule, which the PP no longer bothers to defend, is still in a drawer. And now the conservatives have lost their majority within the courthouse.","Spain's Constitutional Court, dominated by the conservative Popular Party (PP) for the last nine years, has changed the country in many ways.",NEU,0.9635222554206848
