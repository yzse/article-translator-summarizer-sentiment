01-10-2023,"El Gobierno comienza a repatriar desde Siria a las esposas e hijos de los yihadistas del ISIS 
","Two women and their 13 children arrive at Torrejón de Ardoz military airport in Madrid. Communication problems have prevented the repatriation of a third Spanish woman located in northeastern Syria.Two of the Spanish wives and widows of Islamic State jihadists (ISIS) who were interned in prison camps under the control of Kurdish militias in northern Syria arrived last night in Spain, according to well-known sources of the repatriation process. The two women are Yolanda Martínez, 37, and Luna Fernández, 34. Martínez is accompanied by his four children, while Luna has traveled along with nine minors, five of his children and four other orphaned children he cared for and those who are waiting for his grandparents in the Madrid neighborhood of Moratalaz. According to this newspaper, the family lawyer, José Luis Laso, the two women, investigated by the National High Court, have been arrested and will give a statement to the police on Tuesday, before going to court. Children are already in the custody of the Social Services. The women and minors landed around 23.00 this Monday at Torrejón de Ardoz military airport in Madrid. The families, who received some photographs from the airfield, tried to approach in order to embrace Martínez, Fernández and the minors, but were not granted permission. The Government, as the country advanced in November, undertook at the end of the year the last work to repatriate the four women and 17 minors — the oldest, aged 15; the youngest, already born in captivity, aged only three — with roots in Spain and in the custody of the Kurdish militias since the defeat of ISIS in its last stronghold, the town of Baguz, in March 2019. A month later, a journalist from EL PAÍS managed to locate women in northeastern Syria. Together with Martínez and Fernández were in northern Syria, Lubna Miludi, 29, and Loubna Fares, 43, the latter of Moroccan nationality but with children of a Spanish jihadist. The repatriated women and children were in the Al Roj prison camp in north-eastern Syria, along the border with Turkey. This camp, which houses some 2,000 persons linked to ISIS, has improved access that has allowed the Spanish authorities to expedite the repatriation process. Lubna Miludi, born in Ceuta, meets her seven-year-old son in the countryside south of the town of Al Hol, about 100 kilometers from the other camp, very close to the border with Iraq. Al Hol houses about 60,000 people, including foreigners, Syrians and Iraqis. According to the family lawyer, Miludi's repatriation has not yet been managed because of communication problems with her. These centres, where women and children are held indefinitely without judicial control, have become new Guanthanans in the middle of the Syrian desert. The three Spanish women had asked to return to Spain with the minors in their charge. The eldest of them, Abdurrahman, 15, son of Luna Fernández, was separated from his mother and placed 21 months ago in a correctional facility for children of ISIS fighters. The fourth prisoner, Loubna Fares, a Moroccan widow of Iranian-born Spanish jihadist Navid Sanati, escaped in February 2020 with her three children from Al Hol camp and since then her whereabouts are unknown. Sanati's family, in a recent conversation with EL PAÍS, stated that they do not know the whereabouts of the four. The families of the returnees, who have fought through the judicial, political and media channels for more than three years to get the children back, want to take custody of the minors, a process that will have to be assessed by Social Services. This has been expressed by both the grandfather of Yolanda Martínez's sons, Luis Martínez, and the grandmothers of the children accompanying Luna Fernández, Manuela Grande and Hafida Dadach, and Lubna Miludi's father, Mohamed Miludi. Various ministries, including the Ministry of Defence, are involved in the process of repatriation of women and minors. The objective was, according to sources from the Executive, that they were back before the end of the year, although in the end it has taken a few days. The women will appear before the National High Court because they are investigated for their association with the jihadist Al Andalus Brigade cell, to which their husbands allegedly belonged. They could be accused of having settled in a foreign territory controlled by a terrorist organization to cooperate with it, an offence punishable by the Criminal Code with up to five years ' imprisonment. The four defend that they traveled to the caliphate in 2014 deceived by their husbands and that they did not fight or participate in jihadist actions. The Government had so far refused to repatriate its nationals, despite the fact that Martínez, Fernández and Miludi had already expressed their desire to return to Spain in 2019. The situation has evolved in recent months. Spain had been left alone in its refusal to repatriate its nationals, as the vast majority of EU countries (Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Holland, Finland, Italy, Ireland or Norway) have done so at least partially. Last July it was estimated that 154 European women, including Spanish women, remained in the camps in northeastern Syria.",The first group of migrants arriving in Spain from the Democratic Republic of Congo have begun their journey home.,NEU,0.9803430438041687
01-10-2023,"España exige a Bruselas una relajación temporal de las ayudas de Estado
","The Government wants the changes to be linked to the recovery plan in order to avoid the “threat” to the equal conditions between countries that implies opening hands in a general and permanent way Spain takes positions for which it stands as one of the great economic debates — and geostrategic ones — in the coming months in the European Union: the reform of the rules on state aid. In a document sent by the Government to Brussels to which EL PAÍS has had access, Spain proposes that the rules be amended, but in a “temporary” way to ensure “the rapid deployment of investments” foreseen in the European recovery fund and “avoid the threat to equal conditions that entails a general relaxation of state aid requirements”. The text, which comes before the revision being prepared by the European Commission and which must be ready before the end of this month, blacks out the fears in several capitals about the consequences for the single European market of the massive injection of State aid, such as the EUR 200 billion package approved by Germany to protect households and businesses from rising energy costs. The temporary relaxation that Spain is betting on is explained by the defense of Europe's competitiveness against the great world colossus: China and the United States. There has been suspicions about China and the imbalance in trade relations with the Asian giant for some time now in the EU. With Washington, the alarm went off in the summer, when it approved subsidies to support its industry in the transition to a more environmentally sustainable economy. There is another element: the obstacles encountered by many of the investments raised in the recovery plan to be dealt with quickly in Community competition services, which seek precisely to boost the transition to a decarbonised, more digitised economy with a technologically leading industry. Brussels has already understood that it has to raise its hand on the limitations it imposes on State aid. A clear example is what has happened in the last quarter of the year. In October he proposed to extend the relaxation of these rules for companies that were having a hard time because of the crisis caused by the invasion of Ukraine and the extension of this extraordinary regulation until December 31, 2024. Even before its proposal was formally approved, a debate had already opened on the need to go further, and the President of the European Commission herself, Ursula von der Leyen, has taken it up as her own and talked about the creation of a “fund of sovereignty” to support European investments. The name Von der Leyen gives to this proposal is related to a concept of fashion in the EU for several years now: “strategic autonomy”, to which the adjective “open” is now often added. The qualifier is added because it transcends the field of defence to get into that of the economy as well: in order to achieve the objectives in the first area, there must be technological development and productive capacity in branches such as microchips or electric batteries in which EU partners have lost their foot. They understand in the Community capital and in many of the Member States that achieving these goals requires the public sector to support the private sector, as the United States and China do, if they do not want companies to lose competitiveness. And now the rush has come in. Another example: Commission Vice-President and Competition Officer Margrethe Vestager opened a public consultation with the states in December for a week, just a day before the last European Council, in which this issue was a very prominent topic. A few days later, Germany's economic ministers, Robert Habeck, and France, Bruno Le Maire, published a joint article in the British Financial Times in which they spoke of a reform that would designate strategic sectors and simplify procedures. On this point Spain agrees, as can be seen from the text forwarded to Brussels on Monday. Spain is encountering obstacles for aid under strategic projects for economic recovery and transformation (PERTE) to reach large industry quickly. From there, many began to realize the need to simplify procedures. The Nordic countries also set their position, pointing out the need not to break the single market with large subsidies. Italy, for its part, has called for a new joint fund to finance these investments. The key event that has triggered all these movements has undoubtedly been the adoption in the United States of the anti-inflation law, which carries with it subsidies for industrial goods (electric cars, batteries, components for the generation of renewable energies) that are manufactured there, something that can be processed, government sources explain, in just weeks, against the months when not years that require paperwork and negotiation with Brussels. This not only favours the Made in USA, but can also attract planned investments to the US in Europe. The need to support companies in the face of the difficulties caused by the war (increased energy prices) has also played its part, although for this type of aid Brussels has raised its hand by adopting a temporary regulation that already relaxes procedures and demands, as it did during the harshest moments of the pandemic. However, this is where the suspicions among the partners begin to rise. It was clear when Germany announced that it was going to approve a two-year plan of $200 billion to support families and businesses because of the crisis that is causing the invasion of Ukraine. Italy put the cry in the sky. The Commission asked all countries to inform them of their plans to coordinate the response, in an attempt to prevent anyone from coping with the energy crisis on their own. The size of each state's checkbook is not the same and that may end up putting companies in countries with the most spending capacity in the single market (Germany, Netherlands, Finland, Austria...). All this leads Spain to ask the Executive of Von der Leyen that, given that “investment and strategic projects of recovery plans need to be facilitated”, it would be desirable to “a temporary framework that covers these investments”. “These are critical to ensure that our economy continues to grow and becomes more resilient to supply shocks in global chains and demand restrictions caused by rising interest rates and decreasing liquidity,” the Spanish paper notes. In addition, the approach of the Executive of Pedro Sánchez does not involve asking Brussels for an additional fund. Spain believes that it has more than sufficient spending capacity with the resources allocated in the recovery fund. If nothing is twisted, by 2027 you should have (and spend) about 100 billion more of that approved program to get out of the covid-19 crisis, plus what you already have granted from the first part, about 70 billion. This explains why Madrid is asking Brussels — this Tuesday the Commissioner for the Internal Market, French Thierry Breton, meets with the President of the Government, Pedro Sánchez — that the relaxation of the state aid framework is linked to the investments of the recovery fund. In this way, the reform becomes temporary and “avoids the threat to the fairness of the competition rules that would imply the general loss of State aid rules”. Something like this comes to defend Arancha González Laya, dean of the Paris School of International Affairs and former foreign minister, who believes that the response to the current situation should not go through a revision of the rules that puts the single market at risk. From a much more theoretical point of view, the Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics Paul de Grauwe is not in favour of giving aid to companies: “I do not believe in the ability of the Administration to identify where investments are needed throughout the economy. I believe that the European Union can give money to states to invest in infrastructure or basic research, but no more.”",The European Commission has given its approval to the Spanish Government's proposal for a temporary relaxation of the rules on State aid.,NEU,0.9527155756950378
01-10-2023,"El Gobierno estrena la anhelada prestación por desempleo adaptada a la intermitencia del trabajo cultural
","The Council of Ministers plans today to pass a royal decree that halves the requirements of paid days so that artists and technicians can access the subsidy and allows to reconcile pension and creative activity The most anticipated premiere of the cultural sector is not a film, novel or album. Nor will it be seen on the tables nor will it be played on a console: it will leave the Council of Ministers. The intention, yes, is that it precisely serves to guarantee and reinforce the unstable present and uncertain future of those who create art. Because the royal decree that the government plans to approve this Tuesday—in the absence of last-minute postponements—includes two key measures for culture: an unprecedented unemployment benefit adapted to the precariousness of the sector, for the first time in the democratic history of Spain; and the compatibility between the collection of the retirement pension and any artistic activity that generates economic returns, as the country was able to confirm with two sources that participated in the negotiation. The executive seeks to recognize the complex reality that artistic professionals experience and often suffer: there are weeks of work, where the mobile phone keeps ringing and the portfolio is fed; but practically anyone also faces and especially months of inactivity, silence and null income. And that, hopefully. Because in many cases the days of employment in a year are counted by a handful. In a word, intermittance, something that French legislation, for example, has been collecting for years. And that, now, the royal Spanish decree also wants to protect. Hence, the eligibility requirements for unemployment benefit are lowered: compared to the 360 days paid in the past six years that are usually required, artists and technicians will need about half, a threshold close to the proposal that representatives of the cultural sector put forward to the Ministry of Labour and Social Economy, led by Vice President Yolanda Díaz, during the negotiations. In particular, in addition to the trade unions CC OO and UGT, the Union of Actors and Actresses, ConArte (confederation of artists-workers of the show), the Union of Musicians and Alma, the trade union of screenwriters, sat at the table. The exact duration of the benefit will be revealed this Tuesday: in the last drafts, it was set at 120 days. And its amount has also been the subject of protracted negotiations and will only be definitively known at the press conference at which the Government announces it. It will also be known if it finally enters this royal decree or something else will have to be expected for another measure that lasts, in this case, the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration: a special quota for self-employed people in the cultural sector with very low incomes, below 3,000 euros. The official issues of the Ministry of Culture and Sport's Yearbook of Cultural Statistics 2022 reinforce the need for new measures. In 2021, the cultural sector employed 690,800 people, 3.5% of the labour market. But only 66.6% were wage earners, compared to the overall average of 84.1%. And only one in two has an indefinite contract, again below the national average (63%). The business universe shows the same instability: the expression “cultural industry” actually refers to a sector where 67.1% of the 128,741 registered companies have no employees (i.e., it is a solo autonomous) and 26.8% sum between one and five. In addition, the royal decree seeks to top off other outstanding work for years: since 2019, retired artists can receive pension and, at the same time, copyright. From now on, they will also be allowed to receive income from artistic activities. I mean, basically, keep creating, just like the name of the platform that was born to boost this claim. Its members reported cases of writers who suffered fines or were suspended due to the income generated by their works. For a long time, many of the artistic workers had been demanding all these steps forward. At least since UNESCO recommended in 1980 to its Member States to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks for the sector. And even more since an ad hoc subcommission agreed in June 2018 in Congress a 75-point report for the drafting of the so-called Artist Statute. Some, little by little, became law over these years, as a new “artistic labor contract of temporary duration.” Many of the major changes, however, have come after time, pauses, delays and a pandemic that left the sector as one of the most affected. So much so that some remember that, if the measures approved now would have been then, they would have been the refuge that cultural workers did not have in the face of the hurricane that made them rush. Popular music and performing arts, for example, lost a third of their performances and more than half of their audience between 2019 and 2021, according to the latest Survey of Cultural Habits and Practices of the Ministry of Culture and Sport. And Unesco warned in February last year in a report that the situation of many artists had “passed from precarious to unsustainable” by the pandemic, with losses for the sector of between 20% and 40% of income by 2020 alone. For those who closed or left it it's probably too late. At least they will have an umbrella from now on who could withstand the storm. The Government itself is also somewhat late for its own promises. In July 2021, it established an inter-ministerial commission to promote the project. And in December of the same year, Díaz and the Minister of Culture and Sport, Miquel Iceta, pledged to develop the entire Artist Statute throughout 2022. They were wrong, in this case, in a few weeks. Although, in fact, there are still more measures before we can claim that all 75 points in the 2018 report are law. Tax matters, for example, relating to the retentions of the IRPF. The ultimate goal is a fairer working condition for artists. To continue to create, after all, it is also necessary to continue eating.","Spain's cultural sector has been hit hard by the country's economic crisis, with thousands of jobs lost.",NEG,0.9760087728500366
01-10-2023,"Las tres horas que hicieron temblar los cimientos de la democracia brasileña 
","How a Bolsarista march on foot led to a violent mob that invaded the headquarters of the three powers in Brasilia on Sunday For a large part of the participants in the assault on the heart of Brazilian democracy, Sunday in Brasilia began with a nine-kilometre walk, those separating the Army Headquarters and the Three Powers Square, where the beautiful seats of Congress, the Presidency and the Supreme Court are raised. Together they form an equilateral triangle devised by Oscar Niemeyer, whose work was a collateral victim of the serious manganalist attack. This is a chronology, based on the one carried out by the newspaper O Globo, of the invasion that has shaken the foundations of the republic of Brazil:Saturday. The new minister of justice, former judge Flávio Dino, warns the governor of the Federal District, Ibaneis Rocha, Bolsonaro's ally, that a new batch of baganarists arrives on chartered buses from other cities. The ABIN secret service (in Portuguese) alerts various security agencies to the risk of assaults on public buildings in the next few hours. Sunday, 13 hours in Brasilia: Radical Bolsonarists, who have been camped in barracks for two months all over the country asking the military to strike Lula da Silva, leave the booths where they eat, sleep and pray to head quietly on foot to the Plaza de los Tres Poderidades. The Military Police escort them as if nothing, which is most striking because President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took power a week ago and the ultra-banarists continue to proclaim that there was fraud. The acting state secretary of Public Security of the Federal District has just told the governor in an audio message revealed by Folha de S.Paulo that the protesters, with whom they have negotiated, are advancing peacefully. And he adds a “for now” that, in retrospect, attracts attention. He also tells him that some 150 buses with baganarists have arrived in the city to join the mobilization. After the terrible images that took place the previous day around the world, the Supreme Court has temporarily removed Governor Rocha on Monday, for his connivance and omission before the assailants. Sunday, 14.50: Hundreds of people, dressed in yellow T-shirts and waving Brazilian flags, advance en masse and easily overcome the barrier of agents protecting Congress. Too few for what they have in front of them. The baganarists climb the ramps to the roof, as has happened on some other occasion in recent years, but they go further. They use violence. They kick it against the glazed facades and enter the elegant halls through which their lordships circulate, which are in Christmas recess until the end of the month. The assault begins. Some are filmed making jokes in the plenary and spreading the videos. Vandals stone a police patrol. Sunday 15.10h: The extremists are heading to the building a little further on the left, the presidential palace of Planalto, the same one where a week before Lula received the presidential band from a garbage waste picker. Once inside, they tear apart works of art, furniture, steal presidential security weapons, and try Lula's wife's office, Rosangela Silva, known as Janja. They can't get into the president's office. Sunday 15.40h: The radicals cross the square and invade the seat of the Supreme Court, where they reach the plenary. Sunday 17.55h: Lula, whom the attack has caught in the interior of São Paulo, visiting the victims of the rains, improvises an intervention that is broadcast live on television. He condemns the assault, directly accuses his predecessor Bolsonaro of instigating it, and reveals that he has ordered the federal government to assume the security powers of the Federal District. He quickly returns to Brasilia, where he inspects the damage at night. Sunday 18.30h: the security forces make a huge deployment that includes the cavalry and gradually resume control. A hundred extremists are arrested right there. In about three hours, the headquarters of the Three Powers are again under the control of the authorities. Monday 9h: Lula receives in his office Planalto the heads of the three powers. Throughout the day, he also has meetings with the Minister of Defense and the heads of the Armed Forces and all the governors. At the same time, security forces dismantle the coup camp in Brasilia, arresting some 1,200 people, while those in Rio, Manaus and other capitals are also emptying.

01-10-2023,"¿Por qué la policía militar escoltó a los asaltantes de Brasilia?
","The Bolanarists came to the gates of Congress, the Presidency and the Supreme Court escorted by those who should be in charge of maintaining public safety One of the great differences between the assault on the Capitol, two years ago in Washington, and this Sunday's in the Three Powers Square in Brasilia is that in the United States the surprise factor was crucial for the Trump invasion to succeed. The cops guarding the building gave no credit—some lost their lives to avoid it—and the millions who watched it on television from every corner of the planet, either. They were all stunned. On the other hand, in Brazil, the threat had been obvious and tangible for many months. The surprise here was not the invasion, which was a public threat of manganarism from before even the elections, but that extremists reached the gates of Congress, the Presidency and the Supreme Court escorted by nothing less than the very Military Police, which was responsible for maintaining public security. Once there, ramps designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer went up to symbolize the link between society and institutions. The most serious attack on Brazilian democracy began since the dark chapter of the dictatorship was closed in 1985. The attack occurred when some ministers have not even taken office and a week after Lula took office before an ecstatic crowd. In order to understand the attitude of the uniformed and the politicians from whom they receive orders, it is appropriate to take into account several facts: one, the governor of the Federal District, Ibaneis Rocha, was a first-minute ally of Bolsonaro; two, his public security secretary, Anderson Torres, was a police commissioner who was a minister of justice in the previous government; three, the Military Police are a great electoral cauldron of the ultra-right leader for years. In Brazil, there are countless security forces between the state and federal forces. Piauí magazine estimated a couple of years ago that police and military together with their families are about 9% of the population. Even the secret service (ABIN), which had infiltrated the Bolanarist protests, alerted the day before about the risk of attacks on public buildings, but the deployment was useless in the face of a mass of sick people calling for a military intervention to cut off the passage of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In the countless analyses published on the possibilities of Brazil suffering a coup d'état or some kind of institutional rupture, it was common to read that the troops most likely to accompany the then president in a hypothetical coup adventure would be the military police, who depend on the governors and are usually more ideologized, and not the soldiers of the Armed Forces. Although the continued presence of the coup camps at the gates of the barracks for the past two months had been one of the headbreakers of Lula's new Government, the Secretary of Security of the DF was on vacation abroad. Where? As it turns out, in Florida, the same state elected by Bolsonaro to rest after leaving Brazil two days before Lula's solemn arrival in power. So the security of the capital of Brazil was in the hands of its number two when the Bolanarists who had been camped for two months before the army's main headquarters, nine kilometers in a straight line from the Plaza de los Tres Poderidades, decided to take a march towards the offices of the president, the judges and the deputies who so hated and wanted to see out of the picture. The Supreme Court has removed the governor from office for 90 days and, together with his subordinate, has been accused in very harsh terms: “Absolutely nothing justifies the omission and collusion of the Secretary of Public Security [Anderson, that of vacation in Florida] and the Governor of the Federal District [Rocha] with criminals who previously announced that they would commit violent acts against the constituted powers,” says Judge Alexandre de Moraes in his arguments for temporary dismissal. When the protesters had already launched the invasion on Sunday and Torres was known to be in Florida, the governor still dismissed him. And then he recorded a video apologizing to Lula. It was of little use to him if he intended to save himself. Lula's new minister of justice, Flavio Dino, a former judge and governor, already told Governor Rocha on Saturday that a new batch of baganarists would arrive to reinforce the protest. He undertook to monitor radical movements and maintain security. That's why Minister Dino stayed in one piece when he saw on Sunday that the police didn't put any impediments to getting close to the bowels of Brazilian political power. The exalted broke police barriers in the blink of an eye. Some of them had arrived by bus, others on foot, along the monumental avenues of this capital built in the middle of a plain in the interior of the country to deter the protests of the people and avoid attacks like this. On Sunday, shortly after noon, that is, a couple of hours before the pandemonium broke out, the acting secretary of security sent an apparently reassuring audio to the governor to tell him how the demonstration of baganarists was going and tell him that there were already 150 buses in the DF: “We had a negotiation for them to descend peacefully (...) The climate is very calm (...) a totally peaceful mobilization. Until now. Our intelligence is monitoring and there is no question of aggressiveness,” said Commissioner Fernando Oliveira, according to the transcript published by Folha de. S. Paulo. That so far makes him suspect that he himself was not convinced that they would maintain that attitude. The problem is that once before the two Houses of Congress they started climbing the ramps to the roof of the building. And then they entered the bravas, breaking glass—a symbol of transparent exercise of power—and destroying the wonderful modernist furniture. They came to use hoses to flood some Senate rooms. It began an attack by thousands of people dressed in Brazilian team t-shirts and wrapped in the national teaching—symbols patrimonialized by the Bolanarism—that followed later in the presidential palace of Planalto and culminated the seat of the Supreme Court, the institution that, together with the Lula Workers' Party, concentrated the anger of the far right radicals during the previous term. The destructions in buildings designed by Niemeyer are important. Along with the damage to modernist buildings that have been a treasured heritage by the Brazilian authorities for six decades, the invaders were enraged by some works of art, with the office of the First Lady, Rosangela da Silva, known as Janja, the office of the Director of Communication of the Government and the parliamentary offices of Lula's party and the acronym in which the Vice President almost all his life militated.

","Francisco Blanco assumes the General Secretariat in a year in which Minister Maroto will also leave to be mayor in Madrid At the end of the year, and to the surprise of employers and trade unions, the Minister of Industry, Reyes Maroto, decided to dismiss the Secretary General of Industry, Raúl Blanco. The former socialist senator for Asturias, Francisco Blanco, replaced him in this last year of the legislature, in which two basic objectives have been set: to spend the 4,214 million euros of European funds with which he has to launch the industry, basically from the so-called PERTE, and to approve in the Cortes before the end of the year the Industry Law, another previous commitment to the European Commission to receive the funds of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan. In addition to these commitments will be the management of emerging business crises. The first of the year has been that General Electric’s renewables division threatens the dismissal of 200 workers. The last term of office will not be simple in a cabinet that will experience other changes in a few months, when Maroto herself leaves the Council of Ministers to become a candidate of the PSOE to the mayor's office of Madrid in the May municipalities. The president of the government, Pedro Sánchez, has not yet made known how he intends to cover this loss, although nobody rules out that the ministry (which also includes Tourism and Commerce) is founded on another already existing one, as happened in the PP times, when in a similar remodeling it was assumed by Economy. The Minister's departure will not be the first change in the cabinet. According to various sources, the Government is considering the appointment of a commissioner (with the rank of Undersecretary of State) for each of the four PERTE (Strategic Project for Economic Recovery and Transformation) that the Ministry is developing: decarbonization, agro-food activity, naval sector and electric and connected vehicle. The first two are expected to be approved in the Council of Ministers this Tuesday, according to government sources. After two years of work, the distribution of European funds for the conversion of the automobile, to start the manufacture of electric vehicles, has ended up becoming a stone in the shoe of the ministry. Of the planned €2,975 million, only €834 million, or 28% of the total, has been allocated. Of the 10 projects that have achieved lost grants and soft credits, the most controversial has been the award to Volkswagen Group, which demanded more support for its plan of 10 billion that includes the construction of a battery cell factory and electrification of its range of vehicles produced in Spain from 2025 onwards. Given the low distribution, the Government undertook to create a second call for action for the first half of this year, to involve companies whose projects have been left out, such as the conversion of the Almussafes factory (Valencia) or the new battery cell factory in Extremadura planned by the Chinese Envision. The need to manage over economic resources causes some employers, such as the Anfac car industry, to see with good eyes that the Ministry of Economy absorbs Industry. The new Secretary of Industry assumes the relevance of the PERTE of the electric car, because of the amount of aid it represents, but is cautious in setting goals after the accumulated difficulties in its development: “I do not know if we will be able to spend all the resources, but that should be the objective. It must be completed by involving companies in the sector that are not yet there,” he says, assuming the complexity of starting it without previous references: “There has been a learning process and now we are making some changes.” The challenge now is to convince Brussels that investments can be made in a more open time frame so that companies have time to carry out their plans. Of the rest of PERTE that depend on Industry, only the naval has entered the phase of call to distribute the 1,460 million euros previewed. Companies have time to deliver their proposals until February, the same path that the decarbonisation aid programmes and the agri-food sector will follow. The big problem with this type of call is the limited structure with which Industry counts, so the appointment of commissioners (as already exists in other PERTE of other ministries that land with their own team) should help to give more agility to their elaboration. The second axis is the desired Industry Act, adopted in its first version by the Council of Ministers at the beginning of December. The question is whether Congress will be able to approve it before the end of the legislature. The executive wants to ensure employment in the secondary sector with this new rule, which also aims to anchor greater commitment by companies receiving public aid, since they will have to maintain their activity for at least three years. “The law alone will not serve unless the State Agreement for Industry is also closed,” explains Garbiñe Espejo, secretary general of CC OO’s Industry. This pact is a commitment with which the government has begun, for which the foundations have been agreed with the social partners, but which has not finished. The trade unionist calls for the involvement of other ministries in the area, especially Transition Ecological, the ministry commanded by Teresa Ribera. Juan Antonio Labad, director general of Feique, the chemical employer, warns of the difficulties of pushing forward a law like the industrial one in a last year of term like the current one, with political battle proper to a municipal and regional elections almost in its equator and with the replacement of the entire Industry dome, including the expected departure of the minister. “There has to be strong political leadership, although that doesn’t mean there is a strong minister of industry,” he says, referring to the need to group votes from different parties in the parliamentary arch. Another element that will be relevant to the ministry is its impact on the Spanish presidency of the European Union, which will extend throughout the second half of 2023. Knowledgeable sources say that such a leading role could mean marking the step on issues such as the regulations of new combustion engines or the future of the green hydrogen industry.","The government of Colombia has announced the sacking of a senior official in the industry ministry, following a series of corruption scandals in the sector.",NEG,0.6323492527008057
01-10-2023,"La mayoría progresista del Constitucional no logra pactar quién será el presidente del tribunal
","Conde-Pumpido manages to hold a meeting to discuss whether to elect a single candidate from the group and Balaguer is determined to stay in place.The seven judges who make up the new progressive majority of the Constitutional Court meet on Tuesday to try to avoid the fracture of the group if the two candidates who aspire to hold the presidency of the court, Cándido Conde-Pumpido and María Luisa Balaguer, remain. The preliminary contacts at this meeting have not yielded results. The first count in principle with five votes, including yours, to enter the post, but six are needed. Balaguer, in turn, has the support of the four judges of the conservative sector, and will be able to reach the presidency if at his own vote he also adds that of Judge María Luisa Segoviano, proposed by the PP to accede to the Constitution and accepted by the progressive members of the judiciary with the aim of facilitating the renewal of the body of guarantees itself. For the Government, the important thing was to unblock the Constitution and ensure that it had a progressive majority. Now, you've got it. There are seven progressive magistrates and four conservatives. But the progressives are divided on who should accede to the presidency. That is the difficulty of the situation. Count-Pumpido has the support of the Executive, given his trajectory, in which his seven years stand out, between 2004 and 2011, as Attorney General of the State. Balaguer, in turn, also has broad support at the governmental level, especially in the sector known as “classic feminism” in the socialist orbit. In this general framework, it is the first time that the Constitutional has had five women judges, with parity with the six judges. From the aforementioned section of socialist “classical feminism”, this situation is considered an opportunity to install a gender perspective in the court, and should not be wasted. There are those who ask Segoviano not to cause a fracture in the progressive group. And there are those who ask him to vote fully independently, without unfounded feelings of guilt, because, just as Balaguer might retire, he could take a step next to Conde-Pumpido. With this uncertainty as a defining fact of the situation, the seven judges who form the new progressive majority of the Constitutional will meet on Tuesday. During the recent Christmas holidays there were many calls and speculations among them, but no negotiations to try to solve the dilemma. In theory, everyone comes to the meeting without decisions taken, but in practice everyone knows what is at stake. Most of them can give the first sign of weakness if it breaks before reaching the first curve of the road. Perhaps because of these circumstances, because the problem does not go with them, the four judges of the new conservative minority do not even plan to meet tomorrow to prepare for the plenary session the following day, Wednesday, in which it will be decided on who is the president or president, and who is the vice president of the court. The conservative sector, until yesterday majority in the Constitutional, simply watches over weapons, waiting for the magistrates of the progressive group to define their position. Conservatives support Balaguer because they believe it will be easier to generate a relationship of empathy between sectors under his presidency. And that concept, empathy, seems to have a special relevance right now, because it was also employed by Segoviano to expose his vision of how the court should function from now on, without internal friction and in search of consensus. From the sector that supports Conde-Pumpido it is considered, instead, that it is necessary to move from the muses to the theater, in expression of an ex-judged of the Constitutional. I mean, you have to set rules and make decisions. The first rule would be from this perspective that a group vote should be taken on Tuesday. That is to say, the proposal is that the meeting should focus on electing a candidate from the progressive bloc, and that the next day two candidates from this sector will not compete in the plenary called to elect president or president. The thesis is that we must not divide forces, but give coherence to the new majority, after a period, that of the last nine years, in which the options most identified with the conservative postulates have prospered in the decisions of the court. From the core of support to María Luisa Balaguer the proposal of a meeting to decide if a single candidate of the progressive group reaches the plenary has been seen with strong reservations. At the outset, Balaguer has taken the firm decision to stand before the plenary as a candidate to assume the presidency of the Constitutional. And sources close to the judge herself say she's not going to step back. On the contrary, at that plenary session, it would appeal to the situation of the court as an opportunity, especially in order to ask for support to ensure that the doctrine of the Constitutional reflected its maximum identification with the guarantee of the right to equality. It is not just a question of defending a feminist ideology, but of sending a message to society from a court where, with a composition of six men and five women, a situation very close to parity has been reached for the first time.",Voters in Venezuela go to the polls on Sunday to choose their preferred candidate in the country's presidential election.,NEU,0.9635228514671326
01-10-2023,"Las razones y los riesgos de la vuelta “al barro” de Borja Sémper
","Feijóo has asked him to contribute “moderation” to the PP in the electoral year. The Basque left politics in 2020 disenchanted by Vox’s influence “If this policy of saying the strongest thing continues; if reactionary populism drags us to others, I paint nothing in politics. I won't feel useful. In the mud the populist always wins,” said Borja Sémper in an interview in EL COUNTRY in January 2019. A year later, he abandoned her, convinced that the activity to which he had devoted almost 30 years of his life, most of them putting her in danger threatened by ETA, had been definitively “depreciated”. Asked about those words when announcing his appointment as campaign spokesman and member of the PP’s steering committee this Monday, Sémper admitted that this climate had worsened, but explained that Alberto Núñez Feijóo had asked him to contribute “moderation and centrality” to the party and that after meditating on it he had been convinced that he should “wet”. PP sources say that there will be a “drip” of moderately profiled incorporations, former sorayists who came out in the era of Pablo Casado, especially when it comes to drawing up the lists for the December generals. Alfonso Alonso, who left politics a month after Sémper, denies, for the moment, his return. Sémper (Irun, Gipuzkoa, 47 years old) did not fit into Pablo Casado's PP, who tried to stop Vox's escape of vows by imitating the ultra-incarnated excision by Santiago Abascal, that is, scurring to the right. The signings of Mariano Rajoy’s successor, such as that of Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo, whom the Basque politician publicly confronted after she accused them of being “warm”—“While some were walking on muffled carpets, others were playing our lives”—were going in a different direction. Time gave him the reason. The Congressional spokesperson was dismissed in August 2020 and Casado, the first leader of the primary-elected party, sacrificed by his in February 2022, when he had already undertaken another life away from politics, at Ernst & Young's consultancy. His profile did fit like a glove in the flag of moderation and centrality in which Feijoo was wrapped upon his arrival at the PP presidency — “I don’t come to insult Pedro Sánchez, I come to beat him”; “we have to get Spanish politics out of confrontation and permanent hyperbole...” — but it was hard to convince Sémper to abandon “a peaceful life, far from the mud.” The Basque politician has acknowledged that he has spoken “many and many things” with the former Galician president over the past year. It was last Christmas that he communicated to Ernst & Young his decision to return to politics. In those months of talks, Feijóo has eroded, with words and deeds, the image of moderate manager he had built in the years of absolute majority in Galicia and as baron not aligned with Casado's strategy. He allowed Vox to enter an autonomous government for the first time when he agreed with the PP in Castile and León; he compared Pedro Sanchez to a dictator and recovered ETA in the dialectic of the opposition, something that has always bothered Sémper—”to keep talking so much about ETA is like forgetting that we defeated it.” Time has also shown that some of his predecessor’s problems were hereditary, such as what in PP circles they call “ayusodependence,” in reference to the power of the Madrid president to set the party’s tone and discourse in the opposition. Sémper, faithful to his own library and aware of what happened in these months, is presented as “a soft drink for the second time of play”, convinced that it can help change what he does not like. But to return to the mud involves its dangers and Semper himself augurs “some kind of zarpazo”. The first risk is to become a sort of restraint alibi in a party that has already received him with a controversy: the incendiary tweet of Secretary General Cuca Gamarra, responding in these terms to Pedro Sánchez’s message of condemnation of the assault in Brazil: “With you, in Spain this is now a simple public disorder.” Asked about this in his first public appearance as a PP campaign spokesman, Sémper insisted that the entire party, “from the president, the secretary general and to the last edil,” supports “the legally established government in Brazil.” Nor did he want to fall into the trap set by other comrades by linking him to the proces: “There is no possible comparison.” The spokesman for the Basque Parliament (2005-2020) and candidate for the San Sebastián mayor's office in 2019 returns to politics in the electoral year, with the polls rising for the PP,—the last barometer of 40 dB. for EL COUNTRY points to an increase of 33 seats over its 2019 results—and the possibility of being a minister. But according to all the polls, the popular would need the support of Vox, a party that “does not represent” what Sémper wants for the country, despite his personal “bombproof” relationship with Santiago Abascal, whom he has known since he was 17. When criticisms arise, political leaders of different formations often repeat that parties are “non-sects” and that debate is useful and necessary, but discipline is often imposed in practice. Feijóo's campaign team has just incorporated moderate and Sorrayist profiles, such as that of Inigo de la Serna and Semper himself, but also others from the hard wing, such as Pilar Marcos. Time will tell if the Basque, who has written several books of poetry, is again the loose verse of the PP.",A former member of Spain's governing party has joined the left-wing party of Alberto Nez Feijo.,NEU,0.9278234839439392
01-10-2023,"Hallados en una oficina privada de Biden documentos secretos de cuando era vicepresidente
","The papers have been made available to the National Archives. Trump counters: “When is the FBI going to search Biden’s numerous houses?” U.S. President Joe Biden’s lawyer has reported finding a small number of documents classified as confidential in a closet at Penn Biden Center, a private office of the president. The documents have been made available to the National Archives and the situation is being reviewed by the Department of Justice. His discovery is a blow to the president and an oxygen balloon to his predecessor, Donald Trump, who took secret documents to his mansion in Mar-a-Lago (Florida), which was registered by the FBI last August. Trump hasn't taken long to react after the CBS network gave the first news about documents from the stage when Biden was Barack Obama's vice president. “When is the FBI going to search a raid on Joe Biden’s numerous houses, perhaps even the White House? These documents were definitely not declassified,” he wrote on his social network, Truth Social. According to CBS, documents with classified marks as confidential are about ten. U.S. law requires that the presidential records be kept and made available to the National Archives after the end of office. In an interview for the 60-minute program broadcast last September, the journalist asked the president what he thought when he saw the photograph of the secret documents seized in the Mar-a-Lago registry. Biden replied: “How is that possible? How can anyone be so irresponsible? And I thought, what data was there that could compromise sources and methods? I mean the names of the people who helped... And it’s just... it’s totally irresponsible.” “The White House is cooperating with the National Archives and the Department of Justice on the discovery of what appears to be Obama-Biden Administration records, including a small number of documents with classified brands,” Richard Sauber, President Biden’s special attorney, said in a statement. The documents were discovered when the president's personal attorneys were packing files stored in a locked closet to prepare to vacate office space at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Commitment, a think tank based at the University of Pennsylvania in Washington. Biden regularly used this space from mid-2017 until the beginning of the 2020 presidential election campaign. Although it has not been transcended until now, the documents were discovered on November 2, 2022, according to Sauber. That same day, the Office of the White House Legal Counsel notified the National Archives, which took possession of the materials the next morning. “The discovery of these documents was made by the president’s lawyers. The documents were not the subject of any prior request or investigation by the Archives,” adds Sauber in what appears to be an attempt to distance himself from the papers seized from Trump. “Since that discovery, the president’s personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any record of the Obama-Biden Administration is properly in possession of the Archives,” he concludes. Biden smiled this afternoon in Mexico City, where he is on an official visit, without saying a word when asked if he had any comments to make about the documents. Former President Donald Trump is subject to an investigation by the Department of Justice for the secret papers he took to his Mar-a-Lago mansion and he did not return after insistent requests from the National Archives. The FBI searched his mansion with a court order citing possible crimes for which he was being investigated. The possible crimes, which involve heavy prison sentences, would be obstruction of justice, concealment or malicious maiming of public documents and violations of the spy law, apparently due to the malicious retention of national security documents. The Department of Justice, headed by Merrick Garland, Attorney General appointed by Biden, keeps the investigation open. Republicans have accused Biden of partisan use of the federal government as a political weapon for that and other investigations hanging over Trump. With the new majority just released in the House of Representatives, they intend to set up a commission of inquiry to analyse the actions of the Department of Justice. Garland appointed Jack Smith as a special prosecutor for Trump-related investigations. The head of the Department of Justice has now commissioned the Chicago prosecutor to review the classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, according to CBS, which adds that the FBI is also involved in the prosecutor's investigation. The Chicago prosecutor, John Lausch, was appointed by Trump during his presidency and his appointment seems to seek an appearance of impartiality in the investigation. The other Trump-era federal prosecutor who remains in office after the presidential relay is Delaware, who is in charge of the investigation into Hunter Biden, the president's son. In the case of Trump's papers, the National Archives insistently demanded the return of the documents that the former president had taken from the White House. After ignoring these petitions, there was a request by decision of a grand jury. In response, Trump's lawyers handed over about 40 classified documents. The investigators, however, had indications that presidential documents remained in Mar-a-Lago. The judge ordered a search in which thousands of documents were found, including a hundred considered confidential or secret documents. That resistance of Trump and his lawyers is what is likely to be considered obstruction of justice. Despite the legal differences in both cases, it is a serious setback for Biden that puts Trump on the table to air the thesis of political persecution.
