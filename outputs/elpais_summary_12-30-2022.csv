12-30-2022,"España exigirá una prueba negativa de covid o el certificado de vacunación a los viajeros procedentes de China
","The Minister of Health, Carolina Darias, justifies the measure because of the lack of information provided by the Asian giant and the fear of new variants Spain will ask for a negative diagnostic test or vaccination certificate from China. This was announced by the Minister of Health, Carolina Darias, this Friday morning at a press conference called to report on the situation of the pandemic in the Asian country. The Minister, who has not made progress when the measure will come into effect, has justified it by the lack of information from the Chinese State and the fear that new variants of the virus will enter the scene with greater vaccine escape, transmission capacity or lethality than those currently circulating. “There is concern about the evolution of contagions in China, as well as about the difficulty of making a proper assessment of the situation given the limited information currently available to us,” said Darias. The Spanish government follows in this way the footsteps of Italy, the United States and neighboring countries of Asia such as Japan and Taiwan at a time when the concern for the explosion of contagions that the Asian giant is living after the end of the policy of covid zero that it has followed over the last three years is growing. Darias stressed that Spain and the European Union enjoy an advantage over China, where the low circulation of the virus since 2020 and low vaccination coverage make the population very vulnerable to the virus. ""The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) values the high immunity we have in the EU, especially in our country,"" said the minister. Despite this, the main concern has continued “is that new variants may appear unchecked so far”, a possibility that becomes more relevant given that on 8 January next “a significant increase in passengers from China worldwide is expected” for the definitive end of the restrictions in that country. The Health Commissioner explained in this regard that the meeting of the EU Health Safety Committee was committed to “strengthening the sequencing capacity to detect new variants”. And while Spain continues to be committed to the “greater coordination” possible with the other European countries and is awaiting the meeting to provide a common integrated political response to the entry of passengers from China, on this occasion it has not decided to wait. “We know of the need to act with coordination, but also with speed,” said the minister, who for this reason justified the step announced this morning: “We are going to implement controls at airports by demanding from travelers from China a negative test or the complete vaccination schedule. Health has also convened the Alerts Paper, the expert group that advises the government on health crises, formed also by the communities, “to share the information available and transmit the content of the meeting of the EU Health Safety Committee”. In this regard, the Minister has not ruled out any further measures, including in Spain, if necessary. “We will assess the review of existing protocols and possible measures that would have to be implemented or not according to the epidemiological situation.” Checks at airports will be implemented in Madrid and Barcelona, the two that have direct flights with China from Spain, and will now require coordination between Health and the AENA manager. Preparations will also extend to “the handling of positive cases”, according to Darias. Data from countries such as Italy have shown in recent days very high percentages, close to half of travellers, of positives among travellers arriving from China. Following the emergency meeting of the Health Safety Committee, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides last night sent a letter to the ministers of the sector in which, according to the consultation of THE COUNTRY, she proposed that countries “evaluate” their current systems of genomic surveillance of the SARS-CovV2 virus and “increase” them again in the event that they had been relaxed with the decline of cases in their territory. Kyriakides also considers it “important” to continue — or initiate, for those who did not do so — the monitoring of wastewater, “including key airport sewage” to detect any new covid variant that might appear, either in China or in Europe, reports Silvia Ayuso.",The Spanish government has announced that it is going to implement controls at airports to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus from China.,NEU,0.9470216631889343
12-30-2022,"Explosión de covid en China: incógnitas y certezas de una ola que preocupa al mundo
","The opacity of the Asian giant on the evolution of the pandemic triggers the suspicions of other countries because of the risk of new variants coming up Border controls, meetings at the highest level to analyze the situation, reports that speak of millions of infections a day... The world faced the end of the third year of the coronavirus pandemic with the confidence that 2023 would definitely mark the return to normality. The turn of events in recent days in China, however, has brought back to the present day issues that everyone thought had already been overcome and triggered fears that something might be twisted along the way. It is disturbing what is known about what is happening in China, but, above all, it is worrying about what is not known. The lack of official data on the huge wave of contagion the country is suffering fuels mistrust among the Chinese authorities and triggers speculation. The impact that all this will have on the rest of the world is the great question of substance, but any calculations or forecasts that want to be made face the same problem: data are missing or there is no confidence in those available. The following are the keys to the latest collapse of the pandemic. The Chinese are very poorly immunized against SARS-CoV-2 for two main reasons. The first is that China has pursued a zero-covid policy since the beginning of the pandemic, which involves resorting to all possible measures to prevent the circulation of the virus. The result is that the population has hardly been exposed to the pathogen and therefore has not developed immunity naturally by passing the infection. The second is that it is not very protected by vaccines either. Although initial coverage exceeded 90%, only 69.8% of those over 60 have received the booster dose, which falls to 42.4% in those over 80. According to the 2020 census, 191 million people in China are over 65 years of age. The country's two vaccines, Sinovac and Sinopharm, have also proved less effective than those most used in the West (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and in Russia (Sputnik V). If all of the above offer results above 90%, those produced in China do not reach 80% (even less, according to the most recent studies). The omicron variant, the fastest spread virus ever recorded, arrived in China about a year ago. The strict zero-covid policies followed in the country had kept the previous forms of the virus at bay, but with this so contagious the cases and outbreaks have been happening and the population has been forced to live in an almost permanent confinement and making PCR practically daily. Tension has been accumulating as months go by in the form of unprecedented social protests in the country. The government's reaction was to bury the policy covid zero almost overnight. China has not been the only country to pursue a strict policy of zero covid, which is common in the countries of Asia and Oceania. New Zealand, for example, defined the entire country in August 2021 after detecting a single case. It is common for these countries to experience a sudden increase in cases when restrictions begin to relax, but this is often done gradually and relying on vaccine protection. In China, however, the decision was suddenly implemented on 7 December, at a time when the incidence was already rising. That is, according to experts, under the worst possible conditions. “A country so large, a population so little protected and a sudden withdrawal of almost all restrictions. It’s something we’ve never seen before epidemiologically,” says Quique Bassat, an epidemiologist and ICREA researcher at the ISGlobal Institute (Barcelona). It is impossible to know the real magnitude of this wave. It is no longer mandatory to become a PCR in China and, in addition, the National Health Commission announced on Sunday that it will not continue to provide figures. Officially, China has recorded, since the outbreak of the pandemic, only 5,246 deaths per covid and a dozen since the opening of December 7. Health authorities last week changed the methodology to account for deaths, recognizing only those deaths whose primary causes are pneumonia or respiratory failure. According to Bloomberg, who cites data handled by Chinese health authorities, nearly 250 million people were infected in the country in the first three weeks of the month, 37 million of them alone in one day, on December 20. British company Airfinity, specialized in scientific intelligence, said Thursday that 9,000 people are likely to die every day in China because of the coronavirus, twice as many as a week ago, according to its estimates. All the forecasts point to a gigantic wave of contagion that will cause an avalanche of patients over hospitals. International epidemiologists estimate between one and two million people will die for covid in the country in the year that is about to begin and Chinese specialists anticipate that there will be three great waves of coronavirus this winter: the current one will mainly affect the big cities, while the other two will arrive in rural areas due to the displacements for the lunar New Year vacation, which is celebrated between 21 and 27 January. Another of the unknowns is whether the health system, which has already begun to notice the pressure of care, will be able to weather the situation. According to official data, there are 138,100 intensive care units throughout the country and the number of beds in these rooms is around 10 per 100,000 inhabitants. For experts like Bassat, it is countries with weaker health systems that are most likely to be harmed, in addition to China. “The situation is also worrying for countries with low vaccine coverage and where the circulation of the virus is now low, like Africans. They are also countries that have a strong relationship with China, and the expected increase in the incidence there is being transferred to them,” he says. Since the coronavirus is a pandemic, fear of the emergence of new, more lethal and contagious variants has plagued experts and authorities. And the truth is that an explosion of cases makes the development of new mutations inevitable, although it remains to be seen whether these are relevant from the epidemiological point of view. The Chinese authorities claim to be monitoring the subvariants of omicron circulating throughout the country and have created a database in which the genetic sequences of the virus from samples obtained from three hospitals in each province are shared weekly. Despite these monitoring reports, suspicions persist. “We don’t know what variants are affecting the country. The first thing to do is analyze what is happening and epidemiologically control the situation in the West. It would only be alarming if a new variant other than omicron arrives, but for now it is not known and a policy of transparency is needed in China,” said the spokesperson of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), María del Mar Tomás, this Thursday. Italy has been one of the first countries to ask travellers from China for a negative diagnostic test. The decision was taken after half of the passengers on a flight arriving in Milan from the Asian country on 26 December were positive. Japan, India, Malaysia, Taiwan and the United States have also decided to introduce this control, which the European Union does not consider necessary for the time being. “Coordination of national responses to serious cross-border health threats is crucial,” the European Commission said following the meeting of its Health Safety Committee. Active surveillance through genetic sequencing is for now the bet of The Twenty-seven. Italy has reported that it has not yet detected unknown variants in the samples analysed from China. Spain shall request a negative diagnostic test or vaccination certificate from travellers from China. This was announced by the Minister of Health, Carolina Darias, this Friday at a press conference called to report on the situation of the pandemic in the Asian country.

12-30-2022,"Ventilar sin pasar frío: cómo luchar contra las enfermedades que están en el aire
","Aerosols, as the covid has shown, are the transmission pathway of some pathogens and renewing or cleaning indoor air is essential to reduce the risk of contagion If the birth of modern medicine is to be placed in a moment of history, it could be in the second half of the 19th century, when Louis Pasteur demonstrated germ theory. Infections were not transmitted by myasms that unbalanced the mysterious moods, as was believed since the time of Hippocrates, but through microorganisms present in the water, in the food, in our own hands, and that passed unnoticed until then. The revolution that followed microbial theory also brought with it a side effect: it practically relegated the aerial transmission of pathogens to the category of superstition. Although it was assumed throughout the past with other ailments, such as tuberculosis and measles, the dogma remained that other respiratory infections were not spread by aerosols. Even when I saw her, after much controversy, she came to remember that these diseases can also be in the air. This evolution and the resistance of the health authorities to accept that the coronavirus is spread through the air is addressed by José Luis Jiménez, professor of Environmental Sciences and Chemistry at the University of Colorado. He is in the group of early scientists who warned the World Health Organization about SARS-CoV-2 aerial transmission and has become an activist in demanding measures to clean the air we breathe. The recommendation to ventilate indoors, repeated macholy by experts during the pandemic, seems to conflict with the necessary energy savings in these cold months that coincide with a fossil fuel crisis. It really wouldn't have to be contradictory. Modern building codes impose air renovation procedures without losing temperature. They are dual flow systems with heat recovery that, in winter, take advantage of the foul air that comes out to heat the clean that enters from the outside and in summer do the opposite. It is the mechanism used by homes with the highest energy rating, known as passivhaus (from German, passive house), a private certification that attests to their minimum expenditure. Spanish legislation has a lower level of requirement for common homes, but this type of air renovation is mandatory in public buildings and premises built from 2007. It is established by the Regulations on Thermal Facilities in Buildings, which provides maximum CO2 concentration values in these rooms: an ideal of 350 parts per million (ppm) above the concentration in the outside air, which applies in enclosures such as hospitals or day-care centers. The problem is that buildings prior to this date, which are majority, do not have these requirements, and do not usually comply with this measure. Belén Zalba, an expert in air conditioning at the University of Zaragoza, explains that for years the watertightness of buildings was significantly increased due to energy savings to avoid uncontrolled air intakes, but not enough progress was made in controlled air intakes (mechanical ventilation). “It gave place to the one known as sick building syndrome, although the buildings do not get sick, we sicken the occupants,” he says. Zalba often checks with its CO2 meter. “The limit is between 800 and 1,000 ppm and I have reached over 2,000 ppm, that means I am breathing the air that other people have breathed and that, therefore, there is a risk of disease transmission,” he says. Zalba does not care so much about private homes, since ventilation, although highly recommended, is not enough to prevent contagion with such a close coexistence. This changes when there are visits or on dates like Christmas, where houses become venues for celebrations and can be a source of pathogens. But what really worries Zalba are real estate like nursing homes, which very often do not meet the above standards in the face of pollution and are inhabited by the elderly, the most vulnerable to respiratory infections. In addition to covid, there is firm evidence that air is a vehicle for transmission of others, such as flu, measles, or chickenpox. “And there are many others for whom not too many experiments have been made because of that assumption that had traditionally been transmitted by contact with infected surfaces. “But other coronaviruses, such as catarrals, or the syncitial respiratory virus (which causes bronchiolitis in children) and another series of pathogens are exhaled in aerosols just like SARS-CoV-2, so the logical thing is to assume that they are also spread through the air,” Jimenez insists.”Several scientific publications list an extensive catalog of diseases that can be transmitted by aerosols, as their pathogens travel in tiny droplets that do not fall into the ground and can be suspended in the air for hours. They include anthrax, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, rhinovirus, meningitis, streptococcus, pneumonia, legionelosis, measles, mumps, tuberculosis, covid, SARS and MRS, among others. Jiménez is in line with other scientists who believe that health authorities have not emphasized the importance of clean air enough because that would mean transferring responsibility for regulating it more demandingly. “There is still a insistence on handwashing because that’s something that depends on everyone, if you don’t wash them and catch them, it’s your fault. But you can't help but breathe contaminated air from a local open to the public. If you get infected, the local has a responsibility,” he says. While taking action on this issue may require a high investment if the adequacy of all buildings is added, the costs are much lower than that of treating all respiratory infections, says Lidia Morawska, director of the International Laboratory for Air and Health Quality. “The expense for society of prevention through better designed buildings and the gradual improvement of ventilation in existing buildings is much lower than that of infections. According to some estimates, this would represent only 1% of initial construction costs,” he argues. The necessary facilities depend on the size of the rooms and their use. There are four factors that decisively influence the probability of covid transmission and other air infections: the size of the enclosure (which determines how much air is shared), the number of people who match, the time they spend on it, and the degree of vocalization that occurs. That is, it is not the same risk in a place where people are silent, such as a cinema, that in another where one speaks or, even greater, where one sings or shouts, moments when a greater amount of viruses is expelled. The systems must have a capacity for air renewal according to these four conditioning factors. In a place with adequate infrastructure it would not be necessary to open windows to ventilate. “In fact, it is counterproductive, because of energy efficiency and because it interferes with what already exists,” Zalba explains. A recent research in Italian schools studied 10,000 classrooms, one third of which had a mechanical ventilation system. In them, the risk of covid infection for students dropped by at least 74% compared to classes that had only natural ventilation. Another alternative that Jiménez points out, simpler and cheaper than installing an entire air conditioning system that renews the air, is to clean it. Purifiers with HEPA filters can be used for this purpose, which have been shown to drastically reduce the shared viral air load in case an infected person is present. And a third would be to disinfect it with chemical procedures, even though it discourages it most of the time because health risks can outweigh the benefits. All these methods do not ensure that contagion is avoided. It's a matter of odds, and what you get by cleaning up the air is reducing it. To understand this, experts in this area set the example of tobacco: if there are many people smoking in a room, the air is charged with smoke. If it is not renewed, those who share space will breathe it in large quantities. Let's imagine that instead of smoke, that air is being populated with viruses. The more they inspire, the more likely they are to become ill. And the simplest way that there is today to know how dirty an air is is is to check how much CO2 it has. “The solution is to measure, measure and act on the basis of the measured values,” says Belén Zalba. To raise awareness of the importance of clean air, researchers also resort to an analogy with water: developed countries have taken care to disinfect it in homes and no one can think of drinking if it is of doubtful origin, a caution that is not usually held with what we breathe. “We people inhale 8,000 liters of air throughout the day, eat a kilo of food and drink two liters of water. We need to breathe constantly, so the quality of the air we breathe has a great impact on our health,” enunciates the conclusions of the last International Congress on Air Quality, held in November in Madrid, and calling for more demanding regulations on ventilation of public spaces. “Energy saving does not have to be incompatible with good indoor air quality, provided that the appropriate techniques are used in dimensioning, maintenance and operation of air conditioning facilities”, ditch.",The recent outbreak of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Spain has once again highlighted the importance of cleaning the air we breathe.,NEU,0.7477938532829285
12-30-2022,"La inflación se modera en diciembre al 5,8%, la más baja del año
","The INE advance data improves the 12 months earlier, something that did not happen since February 2021; but the underlying inflation rises strongly and is situated more than one point above the general Taking out the portfolio has become an activity of high risk in 2022. From house bills to weekly purchases, everything has become considerably expensive in an exercise where inflation peaked at almost four decades. That was in July and, since then, it has gradually relaxed. At the end of the year it stands at 5.8%, according to the data advanced in December published this Friday by the National Institute of Statistics (INE). This is the fifth consecutive month of decline, with one point less than the November figure (6.8%). The December inflation is the lowest of the year, reducing the 6.1% increase that the consumer price index (CPI) marked in January. And it is the first time since February 2021 that Spain has experienced inflation lower than that of a year earlier: the indicator stood at 6.5% last December, when the war in Ukraine had not yet begun but energy was already experiencing high price tensions as a result of the post-covid economic revival. If energy prices were once the triggers of the inflationary episode in Spain and most advanced economies, they are also being protagonists in the descalada. The INE highlights, another month, that electricity and fuels are the components that have contributed the most in December to attenuate the progression of the CPI. It is the confirmation of a phenomenon that was expected in part: the light has marked at the end of this month minimal that were not seen in year and a half thanks to very favorable weather conditions. The clothes, shoes and tobacco, on the contrary, pulled the index upwards, according to the statistical institute. What is pressing more and more is the underlying inflation, which ends 2022 at 6.9 per cent. This is important because it is considered an indicator of price developments in the medium term, as it eliminates fresh food and energy products as highly volatile. In fact, while the overall rate has experienced a remarkable decline since August, the underlying peak marks a new peak, above 6.4% last August. In addition, 1.1 points are above the overall rate: since October 2020 there has been no such distance. This is a worrying sign because it acts against the tendency of the CPI to stop: after knowing the data, the General Council of Economists has announced that it increased its inflation forecast for 2023 to 5%, a point more than it estimated so far. For CaixaBank Research, which acknowledges in an analysis released this Friday the “surprise” for the low general data, “the rebound of underlying inflation seems to point to a further escalation of processed food inflation.” And this, the bank’s experts added, “could involve bullish risks.” That is, flattening the growth curve of the CPI will be harder than thought. The other negative note on the improvement that Spain has experienced in the second half of 2022 is food. The INE's advance data, as CaixaBank Research highlights, points out that processed foods are one of the components that have pulled inflation the most up in December. Although until mid-January, when the definitive data are published, the evolution of the whole group of food and non-alcoholic beverages will not be known, this rose last month to 15.3%, just one tenth less than 15.4% of October. These are exorbitant increases that directly hit the purchasing capacity of households by expensive shopping basket. To try to reverse this situation, the latest anti-crisis package approved by the Government earlier this week has adopted measures such as the temporary non-application of VAT to basic foods. But the possible effect of this measure will not yet be reflected in the December price statistics. With the data known this Friday, which the statistical institute will have to confirm in mid-January, ends a year marked by the rise in prices. “Inflation began the previous year,” recalls María Jesús Fernández, a senior economist at Funcas, “but it is true that in the wake of the war in Ukraine it has been aggravated by the effects on the gas market and on certain markets closely linked to agriculture.” The summit was reached in the seventh month of the year, when the CPI progressed 10.8% year-on-year, and since then Spain has experienced a progressive relaxation of inflation until it was ranked in November as the European Union's economy with the lowest indicator. However, the provisional average of the year, with the data known this Friday, would remain at 8.4%. The Minister for Economic Affairs, Nadia Calviño, was satisfied with the data known this Friday. “The reading has to be very positive,” he said in an interview at SER, recalling that inflation “has dropped five points in five months.” The first vice president has also downplayed the increase in the underlying, ensuring that “it is logical” that the components that make it “are taking longer [to go down], in the sense that they also took longer to climb.” In the opposition, however, the focus has been on this aspect. “It’s true that inflation has grown less,” said Juan Bravo, vice-secretary of the PP’s economy, “but the one that is really important, which is the underlying one, has increased in a very important way.” “We have a problem with inflation and underlying inflation,” he added in statements since Jaén that the party has spread on social media. After the increase in the cost of living, there are many effects that have hit the economy, such as the radical shift in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (whose mission is to ensure that inflation is maintained at 2%) and the consequent rise in the price of variable mortgages. The latest underlying inflation data, of following the same trend in Europe, augurs little in the short term for the euro regulator to slow down the increases in official interest rates: in the middle of this month, when he announced the last, he said he expected new increases in 2023. But Fernández points out that, however, economic growth does not seem to have suffered for the moment (GDP is expected to grow in Spain this year above 5% and from what all analyses predicted half a year ago) because high prices “have not yet limited industrial activity and consumption.” In both sections, particularly in that of consumption, which has enjoyed the invaluable support of the recovery of tourism this 2022, it is possible for the expert that “we notice more both effects next year”. What seems certain is that, although declining, inflation will remain high in the coming year. Uncertainties about energy markets, although at a sweet time for Europe thanks to a more favourable winter than expected, have not completely disappeared. “The inflation rate will fall, but we can’t expect prices to fall or return to levels prior to this escalation,” recalls Fernández. In December, despite the moderation of the general indicator, which benefits from the base effect (as the comparison is year-on-year, in this December's photo favors that prices were already high last year), prices actually rose 0.3% compared to November. And in any case, the rising cost of living that Western economies have experienced in recent times will leave a lasting effect that will mark many families. “The loss of purchasing capacity will continue,” concludes the expert.",Spain's inflation rate has fallen below 6% for the first time in more than three years.,NEU,0.6820192337036133
12-30-2022,"Simulador de hipoteca: calcule la cuota de su préstamo
","THE COUNTRY develops a calculator for the mortgage fee based on the variation of the eurobor The eurobor has awakened from a long lethargy. This indicator is the one that determines the price of most variable mortgages in Spain and in 2022 has experienced the steepest escalation in its history. Their variation can put many families with variable mortgages in trouble. To measure the change, THE COUNTRY has developed a calculator that allows to estimate the amount of mortgage fees. The estimate is made using a somewhat simplified formula based on the French amortization system (which is normally used in the Spanish mortgage system) with a constant quota calculation. These clarifications may cause the result obtained to differ slightly from the share of a real mortgage. The tool includes four basic variables of any variable mortgage loan. The remaining amount of loan payable must be entered in the capital. The repayment period is equivalent to the remaining years to return all the money to the lender. The eurobor, as it was said, is the indicator most used in the calculation of the quotas of variable mortgages in Spain. The most common thing is to take the monthly average of the eurobor to one year, which the Banco de España publishes every month here, but there may be loans with other references (eurobor to six months, for example, or other indicators). The spread is the rate that the lender adds to the eurobor: the sum of both (eurobor and differential) implies the total interest of the loan. This, in variable mortgages, is normally calculated once a year (usually the same month in which the mortgage was signed) and serves the payment of the following 12 installments. However, it should be noted that there are also contracts that establish another periodicity (such as two quota reviews per year, for example) or other variables in mortgages. All the data needed for the calculation should be included in the contract, but if the contract is not well understood or if there are doubts after reading it, the recommendation is to go to someone who can clear them. Since the approval of the law regulating real estate credit contracts, which came into force in June 2019, it is up to the notary to clarify the possible doubts, and to make sure that the borrower has understood it.","If you have a variable mortgage, it is important to know how much you will have to pay in fees.",NEU,0.968722939491272

","The footballer has died as a result of colon cancer at Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo, where Pelé, the only footballer who won three World Cups, the first of its kind, died this Thursday at 82 years of age as a result of colon cancer at Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo, as confirmed by his daughter Kely Nascimento. “All we are is because of you, we love you infinitely. Rest in peace,” he wrote on his Instagram account. With him, it ends an era in the history of football and Brazil. Those who had the privilege of watching him play live or have seen him on video accurately remember that head goal with which he opened the score in his third World Cup. The final of the 4-1 against Italy in Mexico 70. A moment that, together with legendary moves and goals, has crystallized in collective memory as the ultimate expression of beautiful, effective and irreverent football. “Nice to meet you, I’m Ronald Reagan, President of the United States. You don’t need to show up because everyone knows who Pelé is,” his host told him on one of his first visits to the White House. Edson Arantes do Nascimento was born on October 23, 1940 in Tres Corações, a small town in Minas Gerais. Son of professional footballer João Ramos, Dondinho, and housewife Celeste, he was baptized Edson in honor of the father of the bulb. Thanks to her gift to football, she was already a local celebrity when she was ten. At the age of 15, his first trip to the coastal city of Santos marked two milestones in his life: he fulfilled his dream of seeing the sea and signed by the club he was always faithful to, the Santos. He started a fulgurating career that led him to be consecrated as one of the best athletes of the 20th century. He premiered the yellow Canarinha T-shirt at the 58th World Cup in Sweden. At 17 and 10 in the back, he ended the final against the host crying like a child after a masterful performance that crowned him as the youngest to lift the trophy. No other footballer has ever won three World Cups, to the pride of Brazilians. Pelé returned home to Sweden 58, Chile 62 and Mexico 70 after delighting a global audience. In the last one, as a great reference of a selection that left an indelible footprint in the history of football next to Rivelino, Jairzinho, Tostão or Gerson. In England 66 going hunting Pelé was almost a rule in the field. After his first World Cup, the teenager acquired an unprecedented fame. O Rei was born. In addition to winning three of the four World Cups he competed, he won six Brazilian leagues and one American, two Intercontinental Cups and two other Libertadores. There are as many definitions of Pelé as there are amateurs. Here's a rival's and a filmmaker's. “The biggest footballer in history was Di Stefano. I refuse to label Pelé as a player. He was above that,” said madridista Puskas, who coincided between 1958 and 1964 with Di Stéfano in Bernabéu. “When the ball reaches Pelé’s feet, football becomes poetry,” declared Pier Paolo Pasolini. The Brazilian achieved excellence in a sport created by rich people that the poor like him—it was boot cleaner—breeded and turned into a mass phenomenon. The talent within the court of that always cheerful black man, who enjoyed dancing with the ball, coincided with the arrival of a new device in homes all over the world. The popularization of television catapulted it to a planetary fame in black and white; then, in full color. Brazil was such a giant and promising country that it had only abolished slavery at the end of the 19th century. Despite his countless triumphs, his international prestige and the juicy offers from Europe, he remained faithful to the Santos shirt (black and white stripes) for two decades (1956-74), until his landing in the United States. After months of negotiations, he said yes to the American project. Henry Kissinger — a football fan — had convinced him to wear a new shirt in a country that was not his own. The signing for the Cosmos of New York in 1975 made him one of the best paid athletes in the world. His mission, popularizing football in the United States. When he retired definitively in 1977 at the age of 36, he had scored 1,281 goals, almost one per game, including 77 with the Brazilian team. He definitely said goodbye to the courts on October 1, 1977 in a friendly New York between his two clubs. Always conciliatory, he played one time with the Saints and another with the Cosmos. More than a game, that was a big televised event. Maybe the embryo of the current football show. From that time they are also his encounters with Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Queen Elizabeth II, Andy Warhol... or his first visits to the presidents of the United States. When Nelson Mandela gave him the first Laureus prize for a lifetime in 2000, he praised his courage, joy and perseverance. Among his exploits with the Saints, he achieved a brief cease-fire in the war of Biafra (Nigeria), decreed on the occasion of the friendly played in the country in 1969. Or Rei always had a reserved box in the stadium of the port city of Santos, which has a museum dedicated to the team and another, to its most idolized neighbor. In the stadium museum they proudly expose their locker and the stretcher Pelé was lying on to concentrate before the matches. He lived his last years in an apartment with sea views in nearby Guarujá. The aches and confinement for the coronavirus, which in October 2020 prevented him from publicly celebrating his 80 years, were no obstacle to further planning travel and public events. In September 2021, a colon tumor was removed. He left the last word about himself in the documentary Pelé, premiered in 2021 and in which he agreed to show his fragility by appearing in a wheelchair. That's right, joking with his old teammates of his life. The triumphs of the football king placed his country on the map. Pelé and Brazil were synonyms. The historian Diana Mendes, who was coordinator of the Football Museum in São Paulo, explains that her successes “consistent with Brazil’s desire to tell the world ‘we are a new country, for the future, and we have some icons to show it, such as bossa nova or Pelé’, turned for the world into the embodiment of excellence after the 58′′ cup. The researcher emphasizes that for Black people in Brazil and around the world their victories and the admiration they aroused have an even deeper meaning. They begin to believe: “If he could reach Olympus, we can too.” A powerful message in a country that presented itself as a democracy indifferent to race, something it never was. “That international projection of Brazil through Pelé dialogues with what the rest of the world wanted to see become reality because in the United States the discussion was still about the civil rights of Black people,” explains historian Mendes. Pelé knew how to shape his career out of the field intelligently, reinvent himself. She studied, was a sports commentator, businessman and even Minister of Sports. But during these decades it was above all a living legend. “I don’t want them to talk well about me when I die,” he told El País Weekly in 2014, shortly before starring in the World Cup that was held in his homeland. He never liked to think about politics. He was accused of being lukewarm in the face of endemic problems in Brazil and with the dictatorship (1964-1985). During the lead years, in which he deployed his most dazzling football, he embraced the dictator Emílio Garrastazu Medici and was indifferent to the repression. When asked about that time in the 2021 documentary, he replied: “Football remained the same. I didn’t notice any difference.” He managed to draw a line between his memorable sports career and his personal life, preserved from the spotlights. Father of four daughters and three sons, he had many girlfriends, including television star Xuxa. He married his third wife in 2016. “No one is interested in knowing much about Edson,” O Rei used to say. I knew the player never let the fans down, he didn't want the man to let them down.

12-30-2022,"Pelé, el fútbol mundial en cuatro letras
","Everything in Pelé was magical, what he did enthroned him, what he was supposed to do divinized him.There is only one way to refer to the King of World Football with four letters: Pelé. Much more than a legend. Much more transcendent than the infinite and vain debate on the hierarchy in the Olympus, the order of Di Stéfano, Pelé, Cruyff, Maradona and Messi, which produce the most consensus when it comes to classifying the most mythic myths. Everyone had their own, Pelé had everything. There was a magical coincidence in it. Di Stéfano finished his career in 1966, just as television ceased to be a luxury. Since 1958, the World Cup Finals had been broadcast, but only some privileged people could see the oral legend that was already circulating about Pelé, Dondinho's son, a modest former player retired for an injury at the age of 24, to which his offspring revered—the genius, with absolute devotion, said that his father had scored five goals in a game. The boy Pelé was a prodigy since Walter Brito, a Brazilian international in the 1934 World Cup, was fascinated to see him play at the Bauru Atletic Club, the team of a municipality in the State of São Paulo to which the family had moved for the football career of Dondinho. With the clinical eye of Walter Brito, Pelé ends up debuting with Santos at the age of 16, with 17 debuting with the Canarinha with a goal to the solemn Argentine goalkeeper Amadeo Carrizo and before the age of 18 already was champion of the world after his teenage period in Sweden. The account of the Brazilian portent was heard or read, but beyond Brazil and the lucky ones who followed him live on one of the universal tours of Saints or in the World Cups of Sweden and Chile (1962), Pelé was only a fable to the public. How to take as real that gesture that his companions and rivals were blushing after a duel with the Juventus of Brazil. It was 1959, and already a national phenomenon the front of the Santos, the White Ballet: Dorval, Mengalvio, Coutinho, Pelé and Pepe. According to witnesses, that day against the Barau, O Rei threw four hats, the last to the rival goalkeeper, and marked from head to door empty. The goal was never filmed. Very much in agreement with Pelé, author of the best goals not goals of the football treasure archive. The head that made the stop of the Englishman Gordon Banks sublime, the parable to the Czech goal Ivo Viktor, the mockery — the body on one side, the ball on the other — before the Uruguayan Ladislao Mazurkiewicz... People amazed at the tabelinhas, the fascinating walls prodigious O Rei and Coutinho. Everything in Pelé was magical, what he did enthroned him, what he was supposed to do divinized him. A cunning footballer, as a joker, with a privileged physicist, who intimated as few with the goal. The first great Houdini to transcend in such a way. Pelé arrived at the Swedish World Cup as an alternate. His position corresponded to José Altafani, an Italian-Brazilian who left a great footprint on calcium (Napoles, Milan, Juventus, Torino), where he was nicknamed Mazzola because he evoked the great Valentino Mazzola, star of the tragic Torino that crashed in Superga in 1949. To the third match of the Scandinavian date Pelé has already defiled as a headline and scored in the remaining three, against Wales, France and Sweden. In total, six goals in four games. Her tears after winning the final to the host selection, with a doublet of hers, symbolized an ecstatic child on a world summit. And what a boy. The first of the two goals that he sealed in the final was anthological. He received a center of Zagallo—which would be his selector in the 1970 World Cup of Mexico, Brazil's top work, the apotheosis of the best team in history—he threw two hats, the first with a chest do and ambushed. Glorious. The Brazilian star race was limited to Santos and Brazil. He never embarked on Europe, which in some sectors was always reproached. With the Santos he won 45 titles. And as much as the Peixe squeezed him, as the São Paulo team was nicknamed, on tour, that his body resented more and more frequently. In Chile 62, a problem in the groin prevents him from playing more than two games, in which he scores a goal. In England 66, the Portuguese massacre, with Morais as the main killer, left Pelé almost without tournament (two matches, one goal) and Brazil in the gutter in the first phase. Quite an impact, the double champion into exile on a periquet. The resurrection of Pelé and Brazil would be extraordinary. The best selection in history was being made. Destination: Mexico 70. José Saldanha was quite a character. Futbolista del Botafogo, went through sports journalism, was a selector and member of the Communist Party. His arrival at the front of the Canarinha had his crumb. There are those who always suspected that the president of the Brazilian federation—and after FIFA—João Havelange, gave him the charge with the expectation that the criticism would be be benevolent because it was one of those of the guild. Saldanha was a peculiar guy, even came to threaten revolver in hand. The dictatorship wanted to impose players on him, to which the communist selector refused. It was so difficult to twist his arm that he took Pele to the dark room of the suplenence in a friendly with Bulgaria, a colossal event throughout Brazil. Saldanha argued that O Rei looked bad... that it was complicated to fit someone who was already approaching the age of 30 and had his body beaten to death in a team with Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostão and Rivelino. The scandal was such that within a few months of the 1970 World Cup, Saldanha was relieved by Mario Zagallo, Pelé's former international companion. Zagallo gathered the pretorians of the squad at the Das Palmeiras Hotel in Rio, defined the role of each and emerged the totemic front of the Five Tens, because all, the four mentioned plus Pelé, were ten in their teams, although Jairzinho—which would mark in all matches on Mexican soil, unique record in the history of the Worlds—had been before the move as extreme. Brazil razed and fascinated equally in the Mexican tournament, in which Pelé, who had insinuated four years before he would not return to the team, raised his third Cup after scoring four goals in six games, one of them in the final against Italy. At that time, with television already as a common appliance, no one doubted that the throne of world football had a unique Rei. The one that allowed a single footballer to be made in four letters: Pelé.

","Those who raised football the most in the 20th century were divided by a plethoraic biblical fight of suspicion, ego and competitiveness, but also with their different profiles on the slopes Without telling the leaders or the comrades of their first team, Argentinos Juniors, an 18-year-old Diego Maradona escaped to Buenos Aires airport after a match against Hurricane, in April 1979: he had an agreed appointment to meet the next day, in Rio de Janeiro, Pelé. On the trip he entrusted to his intimates the weakness he felt for O Rei, who had stopped playing in 1977: “I am dying to meet him, I am satisfied that he will give me five minutes and, if he gives me ten, I am Gardel,” he told them, referring to the mythical tango singer. In fact, within a few hours the Brazilian idol would not give him too much time to meet the young Argentine, but still Maradona was delighted: “Having known Pelé I took him the World Cup I didn’t have,” he said, as if those minutes of talk replaced the pain due to his absence from the World Cup won by Argentina the previous year. “I knew Pelé was a god as a player. Now that I have met him, I know he is also a person,” he added. But that admiration of the Argentine, and a certain lack of interest of the Brazilian – which, it is true, saw how all the time we talked about a “new Pelé” without any new star flying to his height – would be broken within a few years. The sparks lit before the World Cup that would canonize Maradona, Mexico 86. Pelé, 45 years old and retired nine years ago, made himself available to the coach of the Brazilian team to play the World Cup. Already with volcanic lava in his language, the Argentine recommended, through the media, that he visit a psychiatrist, to which Pelé – the wounded god – counterattacked: “This is the last great opportunity for Diego to prove that he is the best. In Spain 82 was a disaster. The blows hurt, but you have to have class to avoid them.” Nothing further from reality: in that same Mexico 86, Maradona would live up to the myth of O Rei – and even, for many, in a higher stadium, that of a god of football – and between them the eternal dispute of the throne of the twentieth century would begin. Now it sounds curious, but Maradona first tried to be a diplomat, perhaps in respect to the Brazilian until then incompatible, and threw phrases that would soon be paper chopped: “I don’t want to be King Pelé, Pelé there was only one and the others came in second line”, or “I appreciate the praises, but certain comparisons, like those made with Pelé, seemed exaggerated to me.” However, it was only a matter of time before, in the absence of matches with each other, rivalry was fuelled by statements that from both sides included low blows, with Pelé pointing to Maradona's drug addiction and with the Argentine responding with supposed sexual perversions of the Brazilian – in line with the homophobia prevailing in football–, his proximity to power and more than one case of corruption. And then on one side it was said “Pele is gay” or “Pele debuted (sexually) with a kid” or “Pele is a FIFA puppet”, and on the other it was answered “Maradona is lucky: despite the drug they offer her employment, it is a negative example.” Those who raised football the most in the 20th century – one at the beginning of the satellite game broadcasts, the other with the arrival of football in color to the whole world – were divided by a plethoraic biblical fight of suspicion, ego and competitiveness, but also with its different profiles to the back: I fought much more equidistant in politics, always close to the corporate world, and Maradona –even with her multiple contradictions – as a spokesman for her neighborhood origin and proletarian class. It is true, too, that there were cordial and even affectionate reunions, as in 2005, when Pelé visited Maradona on his television show in Buenos Aires, or as in 2016, when a microphone lit in a commercial engagement let Maradona's criticism of the 21st century king, Lionel Messi, but the short circuits never disappeared. Perhaps the most remembered is in a FIFA vote in 2000, when Maradona won the election of the best player of the 20th century by popular vote and Joseph Blatter, not to leave a man of the house like the Brazilian, made him share the first place with Pelé. “When I hugged Pelé in Rome,” Diego said, “I almost asked him how he felt about getting out second, but it would have been for quilombo.” Within a few days, the Argentine would redouble the anger beyond the death of both, as if the rivalry for the soccer throne were eternal: “If I died and in heaven I could play football, I would not want to do it with Pelé.” You can follow THE COUNTRY Sports on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter.","Diego Maradona and Pelé were two of the greatest players in the history of football, but they were not the same person.",POS,0.9526680707931519
12-30-2022,"El increíble arte de traducir las lenguas prerromanas sin una piedra Rosetta
","The epigraphist Manuel Gómez-Moreno deciphered the writing of the peoples of Hispania as measured in the 20th century, which allows us to read inscriptions such as the recent discovery of the Hand of Irulegi Jean-François Champollion (1790-1832), considered the father of modern Egyptology, has passed into history because he was the first to decipher, two centuries ago, in 1822, the hieroglyphic writing, thanks to the study of the Rosetta Stone, the same text in three languages (egypcio hieroglypho, demotic writing, typical of the priestly caste, and Greek) that was found in 1799 during the Napoleonic campaigns in Egypt. For this reason, the name of the great French epigrapher is remembered in multiple articles, books, studies, films, documentaries, statues, streets... However, it is not the same with the Granadan Manuel Gómez-Moreno (1870-1970), who decrypted the pre-Roman writings in the mid-20th century — but without Rosetta stone by means — armed only with notebooks and pencils. His name thus returns to the foreground after the recent discovery of the so-called Mano de Irulegi near Pamplona, an object of 2,100 years ago, with 40 characters in the protovasca language and the translation of his first word (sorioneku, good augury) by the professors Javier Velaza and Joaquín Gorrochategui. How could these unravel their meaning?The five great languages (lusitan, Celtiberian, Iberian, protovasco and Tartesic) that were spoken at the time the Romans landed on the peninsula (218 BC) can be read and interpreted thanks to epigraphists such as the Marquis of Valdeflores (1722-1772), Gómez-Moreno and Antonio Tovar (1911-1985), although there are still many doubts and unknowns that need to be cleared. Martin Almagro Gorbea (Barcelona, 76), a former professor of Prehistory and specialist in Iberian protohistory, sums it up as follows: “Currently, it is only discussed if in a text he puts ‘this is the wake of Fulano’ or if, on the contrary, he has to be translated as ‘here he is buried Fulano’. And we owe it, in large part, to Gómez-Moreno, the great Spanish epigrapher.” The Iberian Peninsula was always a sort of reservoir of Indo-European and non-Indo-European languages. Being in the Finisterre of the continent and therefore far from the great western migratory flows, their languages remained archaizing and with little change. The inhabitants of Hispania, divided into two large land masses (Atlantic and Mediterranean), were strongly cohesive for commercial reasons, which caused many of them to be possibly bilingual. For example, the herds of Celtic transhumant shepherds from the north graze in winter in southern Tartessos or Gadir, an eminently Mediterranean city, but in the middle of the Atlantic. In the Third Millennium B.C., Indo-European people from Ukraine and southern Russia penetrated the Baltic, generating the Germanic languages of northern Europe, while those who moved to the West gave rise to the Celtics. The fact that this human group carried the genetic group R1b – which allowed them, for example, to assimilate milk proteins and accumulate large stocks of ferritin, which facilitated their survival and expansion – has led researchers to follow their language trail in Hispania and Europe. Thus they have determined that the protocelts settled on the Peninsula in mosaic form throughout the Atlantic area and with them came the language that the linguists call lusitano. When the writing appeared, two millennia later, its idiomatic footprint became visible from the peninsular north to Sierra Morena. In the Mediterranean areas, however, the Iberian language was spoken. This language came from Anatolia, Turkey, and was extended in the Fifth Millennium through the Western Mediterranean. It prevailed in the Spanish Levante, Jaén and Andalusia Oriental, where it coincided with the culture of the Argar and the proto-Tartesic, which had its own language, the Tartesic (zone of Huelva and south of Portugal). The Iberian language was also related by contact, in the north peninsular with the protovasque, although the latter can also be interconnected with the protosardo. In the 1200's. C, through the eastern steps of the Pyrenees came people of a Celtic culture known as the urn fields, a name they received because they had the habit of incinerating their dead and burying them inside vessels in large necropolis. In its expansion they reached the area of Alto Jalon (Zaragoza), the Iberian System, Soria and Guadalajara. They are what is known as Celtiberians, a human group that imposed itself in these areas on the oldest Celts that had been settled in the Peninsula for centuries. His language, the Celtibérico, is therefore very close to the Celtic languages of Europe, although due to its geographical location it did not evolve as much as its brothers: the Celtic Gaelic or the Celtic Gaelic. These Celtiberians then moved to the peninsular West – they were cattle ranchers – thus absorbing linguistically other Iberian peoples in those areas, such as the vacceos or the vetons, which were celtiberized. They extended to an imaginary line from the current Astorga to Mérida. To the west of this strip, instead, the Indo-European language of the Lusitans remained, in what today is Galicia, Portugal and Extremadura. His language had, like Spanish, only five vowels. Only a hundred words are preserved from this language, halfway between Celtic and Italic, so their interpretation is still difficult. Possibly, it is a language that broke down when Celtic and Italic had not yet been differentiated with the first migrations. Unlike the rest of Iberian villages, the Lusitans only began to write once conquered by the legions of Rome. In fact, there are some inscriptions of Lusitan priests with ritual instructions, but with a prologue in Latin. This language was identified by Antonio Tovar in the fifties of the last century. The Iberian elites, on the contrary, did know the writing: they took it from the Tartheists in the 6th century B.C.—they maintained commercial relations with them—which, in turn, adapted it from the Phoenicians towards the 8th century B.C. This alphabet develops a semi-silabic system, consisting of writing liquid and nasal vowels and consonants with a single sign, but also uses only sign for the occlusive syllables (syllable system). The Iberian script is in turn divided into southern (Andalusia, Murcia and Alicante) and Levantine (from Valencia to Rosellón, in France). The Celtiberians, for their part, copied the writing of the Iberians, so that it is the same with practically some variations. The discovery of the Hand of Irulegi in Navarre, 40 signs, shows that the protovascos took – also with some variations to reproduce sounds typical of their language – the writing of the Celtiberians. The Basque language was spoken to the south of the Pyrenees, between Jaca and Navarre to Aquitaine (south of France), not in the current Basque Country, whose inhabitants understood themselves in Celtic, as the names of the geographical accidents (Deva or Nervión, for example) show. What is now Euskadi was only linguistically Basque during the Middle Ages, so this territory was known since then as Las Vascongadas, which means the lands that were Basqued. But how is it possible to interpret all these tongues without Rosetta stone? The first to identify the Celtic language was the Marquis of Valdeflores, Luis Joseph Velázquez de Velasco and Cruzado, in the 18th century. He wrote a treatise on his signs thanks to the coins he managed to identify from the time. But the spectacular jump occurred with the studies of Manuel Gómez-Moreno, who compared the inscriptions of the Celtic coins with the Roman ones of the same city. So the village name written on the two numismatic pieces made it possible to compare the two scriptures and come to understand their symbols. However, his great contribution was to discover the semi-silabibic system (alphabet composed of letters and syllables). The Lusitano, for its part, was untangled by Tovar years later. The German Jürgen Untermann (1918-2013) compiled a vocabulary in his Monumenta linguarum Hispanicarum from all the untaught words of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, the Lusitano is known about a hundred, the Tarthesic about tens – because almost no inscriptions have been found –, the Iberian and the Celtic almost a thousand of each. And of all these words how many are understood? “We read 80% of the Celtibéricas and 60% of the Iberians with certainty, while of the Tarthesic, very few because the experts do not agree if it is an Indo-European language mixed with ancient elements. Lusitane means 60 per cent. But this does not mean that the languages have been untangled in this percentage, but that we are able to read in those so many percent the texts we have found,” explains Martín Almagro. Currently, experts are trying to make progress through artificial intelligence. “First they are making the corporat [databases of the words identified] and, when we have them, they will get into the computers. There are linguists working on it, but if you don't have data, you can't move forward. Archaeology is behind on this. We keep looking for coins by looking at them in the books. The logical thing would be to put them in a scanner and find parallels,” adds the professor. There is a database (hesperia.ucm.es) that makes available to the interested parties everything that the linguists know about the Tarthesic, Celtiberic, Iberian and Protovac. It is freely accessible and in its maps you can locate and read everything that is known about the inscriptions found. It does not include translations, but it does include the description of the objects (from coins to tombstones) with the words engraved on them and the archaeological context in which they were found.","The great Spanish epigrapher Manuel Gmez-Moreno, who deciphered the writings of the peoples of Hispania as measured in the 20th century, has passed into history because he was the first to decipher, two centuries ago, in 1822, the hieroglyphic writing, thanks to the study of the Rosetta Stone, the same text in three languages (egypcio hie",NEU,0.5389869809150696
