12-29-2022,"Los gobiernos de Turquía y Siria se reúnen por primera vez tras 11 años de guerra
","The process of rapprochement between the two countries, under the mediation of Russia, aims at the return of Syrian refugees and to confront the activities of armed groups on the border The ministers of defence of Turkey and Syria met this Wednesday in Moscow for the first time since the civil war in the Arab country began in 2011, in which both governments are deeply involved. The thaw process, which has been under Russian mediation for weeks, focuses on refugee issues — which may jeopardize the re-election of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the 2023 elections — and the Kurdish militias in northern Syria, against which Ankara wants to carry out a new military offensive. For the regime of Bachar the Assad is a way to break its international isolation, especially at a time of severe economic crisis. “During this constructive meeting, the Syrian crisis, the issue of refugees and joint efforts to combat all terrorist organizations on Syrian soil were discussed,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement following the meeting in which Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigú and his Turkish and Syrian counterparts Hulusi Akar and Ali Mahmud Abbas participated. The meeting was also attended by the heads of Turkish spying, Hakan Fidan, and Syrian, Ali Mamluk, who had already met. On his return from Moscow this Thursday, Akar said that such meetings will “continue” in order to contribute “to peace and stability” in Syria. It is expected that in the coming weeks the Foreign Ministers of both countries will meet (also within this trilateral format), with the view to a meeting between El Asad and Erdogan in the first months of 2023, despite the fact that, until recently, the Turkish President referred to the Syrian as “the butcher of Damascus”. “Turkey has long abandoned its plans to promote regime change in Syria and is working together with Russia and Iran for stabilization [of the conflict]. The calculation now is that it is more useful for Turkey’s national interest to establish a direct relationship with Damascus,” says Sinan Ülgen, researcher at think-tank Carnegie Europe. One of the major problems facing the negotiations is the definition of “terrorism”. For Damascus, the opposition and rebel groups that are maintained thanks to Turkey's support are terrorists. For Ankara, the Kurdish militias who, on several fronts along the border, fight along the same lines as the regime (and also have the support of the United States in the north-eastern part of Syria). Following the attack on 13 November in Istanbul, of which Ankara accused the Kurdish armed group PKK and its Syrian subsidiary YPG — both organizations have denied their involvement — the Turkish Government has increased its threats to intervene militarily on Syrian soil to end Kurdish militias, whose positions it has bombed from Turkish territory. These immense differences make it difficult to reach an agreement between Ankara and Damascus, according to Ömer Özkizilcik, an expert in the Syrian conflict. “Russia has prevented Turkey from intervening against YPGs since 2019, and insists Ankara that all its security concerns can be resolved through direct dialogue with the Damascus government,” explains this analyst: “The problem is that El Asad cannot meet Turkish demands. The YPGs and the regime are very imbued in northern Syria, they share bases and positions. When Turkey bombards the YPG, it also kills regime soldiers.” On the other hand, the demands of Damascus are also extremely complicated to carry out for Ankara. In fact, this Thursday, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Mevlüt Çavusoglu, reiterated that his country is “the guarantor of the Syrian opposition” and that it will not act against its interests. “If Turkey ceases to protect the rebels and withdraws from the territory it controls in northern Syria [almost 9,000 square kilometres], the Syrian regime will regain its military control, which will mean a humanitarian disaster and a new wave of refugees, which is precisely what the Turkish government wants to avoid,” says analyst Özkizilcik. For the Erdogan government, the important thing about this process is “to have a face-to-face meeting with El Assad before the elections [scheduled to be held by next June], which will allow Turkish public opinion to say that a dialogue has begun for the return of refugees,” says Ülgen. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, but public opinion has turned mostly against them as the economic situation worsened and the opposition flagged anti-immigration sentiment. One of the star promises of the Turkish opposition is to start a dialogue with the regime of El Assad in order to agree on the return of refugees, so adopting the same strategy that until recently rejected flatly, Erdogan manages to deactivate one of the keys of the program of his rivals. Another thing is that the proposal is feasible: most refugee associations do not believe a return to the same Syria of El Assad from which they fled is feasible. “At the moment, however, I think it is more important [for Erdogan] the message that conveys than the result itself,” concludes Ülgen. The Turkish-Syrian thaw is part of the political realignment that has taken place in recent years in the Middle East. If, in the wake of the Arab Spring, Turkey had opted for an idealist and interventionist policy, seeking to increase its regional influence through support for political parties and rebel groups — mostly Islamist ones — opposed to the traditional authoritarian regimes in the area, it has now adopted much more pragmatic diplomacy. Thus, in recent months, it has completed reconciliation with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel, and is in the process of doing so with Egypt, which has resulted in a flood of funds and investments from the Gulf monarchies and Russia that have allowed the Turkish currency to stabilize at a time of great financial difficulties. In return, however, the thousands of political exiles from the Middle East who had found in Istanbul a haven and a base from which to fight oppression in their countries of origin have seen increasing difficulties in staying in Turkey or that the authorities demand that they reduce the tone in their publications and media broadcast from Turkish territory.

12-29-2022,"La dimisión del ministro de Infraestructuras abre una crisis política en el Gobierno portugués
","Pedro Nuno Santos, the main candidate to succeed António Costa, resigns for compensation paid by the public airline TAP after being saved from bankruptcy An compensation agreed a year ago in the Portuguese airline TAP has taken the most political minister of the government of António Costa and one of the most serious seekers to succeed him. Pedro Nuno Santos, 45, resigned on Wednesday as Minister of Infrastructures and Housing for the controversial compensation of 500,000 euros given to Alexandra Reis, former administrator of the airline under his ministry. Reis was compensated for leaving her post early and a few months later she was appointed to another public office in the same ministry. However, it has not been known until now, after Reis was appointed Secretary of State for the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance, a position from which she has been dismissed after the scandal. The TAP, which was in such a delicate situation that it received an injection of €3.2 billion in public aid to prevent its bankruptcy, agreed to compensate Reis in January, who a few months later was appointed executive president of Portuguese Air Navigation (NAV), a public body under the Ministry of Infrastructure and Housing. The two operations, the compensation and the filing, were blessed by the Secretary of State for Infrastructures, Hugo Santos, the minister's right-hand man. In a statement, Pedro Nuno Santos states that he did not know the remuneration pact signed with Reis but that he assumes political responsibility “in the face of the public perception and the general collective feeling created by this case”. In another statement, Prime Minister António Costa thanked him for his seven years of work in the Government and, in particular, “his decisive contribution to the creation of conditions of political stability as Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs”. The controversy has grown in intensity since the compensation was revealed by the Correio da Manhã shortly after Reis was appointed Secretary of State for the Treasury. Reis's fulgurating career fell apart this Tuesday, when he had to resign his new position in the face of the scandal that provoked between the opposition and the Portuguese press that he would receive half a million euros from a public company that the State had had to save in extremis. In the days when Reis negotiated his departure from the TAP, Costa lived one of the happiest moments of his political career. Against wind and tide, the prime minister achieved an absolute majority at the polls, which allowed for a time of stability. However, since the formation of the new Government, there have been episodes and crises that have led to the departure of two ministers and nine secretaries of State. The last case is also the one of the greatest political significance, since Pedro Nuno Santos was one of the ministers with the most projection both inside and outside the Socialist Party. He was also one of the most leftists in a government where Costa has seated more moderate dolphins and more to his liking as Finance Minister Fernando Medina. The crisis shows several paradoxes. The first is that the government created by Costa from the absolute majority knows a greater political instability than those that depended on the agreements in the Assembly of the Republic with the partners of the Geringonça, the parliamentary alliance of the Socialists with the Bloco de Esquerda and the Portuguese Communist Party, which allowed Costa to become prime minister in 2015 despite not having won the elections. Mumbler of the solidity of this political understanding was Pedro Nuno Santos as Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs. Cohabitation broke down in the second legislature abruptly, when the rejection by the former partners of the State Budgets of 2022 led to the advance of the elections. The second paradox is that the minister's departure weakens the government more than the resignation. The Social Democratic Party (PSD, center-right) has called for an urgent debate for Costa to give explanations, while the Liberal Initiative, the fourth parliamentary force, announced a motion of censure. However, no one considers the options of Pedro Nuno Santos as Costa's successor buried. He has a deep knowledge of the internal structure of the Socialist Party and a remarkable support of the militancy, although he also provokes important rejections because of his vehement and sometimes radical style. During the troika crisis he came to mention the possibility of not paying the public debt that corroded the country to the German and French banks. The third is that Pedro Nuno Santos resigns for political responsibility in this case, where he seems to have failed more by omission than by action. The minister, however, had resisted leaving office in two previous controversies. Pedro Nuno Santos caused the government’s first political crisis, the only one considered “serious” by the prime minister, when he issued a decree deciding the location of the new Lisbon airport, a matter that has been dragging on for more than half a century. Costa's fulminant reaction, which immediately disapproved him, suggested that he would leave the Government, either by dismissal or by resignation. After an interview between the two, neither happened. The next controversy involving Pedro Nuno Santos had to do with his participation in the family business run by his father, who had signed several contracts with state agencies. The minister, who had 1% of the shares, took refuge in a report he had requested from the Attorney General of the Republic in 2019, which concluded that there were no incompatibilities. The law in force prohibits public contracts for companies that have in their shareholding members of the Government holding more than 10 per cent of the shares. The departure of Pedro Nuno Santos, the main advocate of the nationalization of the TAP to save it from the bankruptcy and the commitment to the railway as transport of the future, occurs when the process of reprivatization of the Portuguese airline is open. A few months ago he presented the National Railway Plan, which contemplated four international connections with Spain, including those of high speed between the two Iberian capitals (Lisbon-Madrid) and the Atlantic corridor (Oporto-Vigo).

","The deterioration of their habitat and the illegal fishing corral the African manatee, a species wrapped in a halo of mystery fed by the legends “We, the diola, cannot fish them. To catch one you must have mystical powers, it is forbidden by tradition.” Sitting by the banks of the Casamance River, the fat Louis Diatta searches the surface of the water and speaks of strange animals that inhabit it as if they were people. “They’re like us. The females have breasts and breastfeed their babies, they go in family. Instead of arms and legs they have fins, but when you look them in the eyes you are surprised, it is as if they were half human,” he adds. The Pointe de Saint George is one of the few places in Senegal where you can see the Manatees of West Africa, a species threatened and surrounded by mysteries. That, if you're lucky, because like good animals of legend they are shy and elusive. Although the capture, sale and consumption of West African manatee has been formally prohibited since 2013, the truth is that there is a flourishing illegal trade destined mainly for Asian countries of meat, skin and manatee oil, to which healing properties are attributed. This fishing, coupled with pollution, dams, the disappearance of mangroves and by-catches, corral this sirenid, of which it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 specimens scattered over the coastal and estuary waters of about ten countries. The Pointe de Saint George, an observation tower, now awaiting restoration, rises on the beach so that tourists try to get a prized image of the Trichechus Senegalensis. “There’s a fresh water fountain nearby and the Baliali (their name in diola) like to come and drink,” says Diatta. The road to this place is as magical as the manatees themselves. In just nine kilometers it is crossed by huge flamingoyans and baobabs, rice fields and mangroves, treading the path that united this town with the rest of the world. Here and there, as it could not be otherwise among the diola people, you can see bones of animals and pumpkins placed carefully. “It’s the fetishes. This is the protector of the road,” says Kanyar, a local guide, “that’s why it’s a safe place.” If anyone finds any lost objects, they have an obligation to deposit them here. On one occasion, a tourist neglected his valuable camera of photos on a branch. “The next day I was next to the fetish,” Kanyar says with a smile. The same respect for the traditions of their ancestors, which makes them return the objects they find, prevents them from capturing manatees, although sometimes they are trapped in the nets of shrimp fishermen and die suffocated. “I’ve seen it more than once. Anyone who does this has an obligation to notify the authorities, because otherwise a fine may be fined. They are accidents,” says Diatta, who has baptized her beach camp as Le Lamantin, the French name of this animal. Neglects and confusions have always been very present in the mythology of manatee. Legend has it that a long time ago and just after his wedding, a couple of newlyweds went to a lagoon to bathe and that, being alone and sheltered from indiscreet looks, they began to have sex. However, the bride’s father also wanted to go freshen up and stumbled by surprise with the young lovers. So much was the shame that the couple felt that they decided to stay forever in the water and that's how they became manatees. This is the story that the children are told by the children and that, intermingled with the taboo of nudity and sex, reinforces the average human character of the animal. In the Bijagos archipelago of neighboring Guinea-Bisau they are identified with the legend of Mami Wata, a water divinity that is often described as a female entity, half human and half fish, both extraordinary and powerful. According to tradition, Mommy Wata kidnaps lost bathers or travelers and, if she allows them to return, gives them a unique intelligence and wisdom. This goddess, whose cult is also present in the voodoo of the Caribbean and America, where she came from the hand of slaves from Benin and Nigeria, is also linked to sexual promiscuity, as in the case of diola stories. For the inhabitants of Pointe de Saint George, as well as for the residents of Bijagos, the Manatees have become a tourist attraction. However, the lack of government support means that the initiatives are carried out by themselves. “The observation tower has been damaged for some time, we are looking to repair it by the fishermen themselves,” says Diatta. While his cousins from Florida or the Amazon have deserved great interest in its conservation and numerous investigations, protected since 1975, the African manatee had to wait 38 years to obtain the same consideration, according to the Robin de Bois association. All this, despite the fact that this herbivore, which can measure more than two meters and weigh about 500 kilos, is essential to control the growth of invasive herbaceous species in the rivers and lagoons of the region. Far from the media glamour of lions, giraffes or elephants, African manatees face numerous dangers for human action. Even climate change and rising temperatures in the calm waters where they live are affecting them. One of the problems is their low reproduction rate: females have only one baby after a pregnancy lasting 12 to 14 months, followed by a two-year breastfeeding period. Already missing in the Central African Republic and probably in Burkina Faso, Angola, Niger, Mali and Chad, this sea cow, as it is also known, resists in very limited spaces in coastal countries, from Senegal to Equatorial Guinea.

12-29-2022,"Heinz Bude, sociólogo: “Hoy somos individuos solitarios y si no nos abrimos a los demás, fracasaremos”
","The influential German thinker tracks the effect on the collective psyche of economic conditions and claims solidarity Heinz Bude (Wuppertal, Germany, 1954) is one of the most influential sociologists of our time. Scholar of generational issues and expert in 1968, Professor of Macrosociology at the University of Kassel is a contemporary diagnoser who tracks how economic conditions affect the collective psyche. He has recently studied the evils of Western society and also its possible solution. He published The Society of Fear (Herder, 2017), where he stated that we are all afraid: to face life from the individuality (abandoned by the states), the loss of vital opportunities, to ignore the expectations of others, who become the enemy... In 2019 he published Solidarität: die zukunft einer großen Idee (Solidarity: the future of a great idea, without translating into Spanish), where he deepens in which he sustains should be our answer. Now, however, he believes that we have entered the stage of the losers. “We all lose,” he says. Bude welcomes in his apartment in Berlin, an enviable place: located on the outskirts of the city (a few minutes from the center by tram), near a lake, surrounded by trees and a garden with at least ten types of flowers (all opened, amazingly) and in which children share sandbox. Bude has arranged cookies on the table in the living room. We speak (in English, he with a strong German accent) and through the large windows the autumn forest flows. QUESTION. Ever since he wrote his book, fear has grown and grown. Answer. The last three decades of neoliberalism have been the stage of vital opportunities. Then many began to wonder if they were missing something. In love, work, even on vacation, always the same question: is this enough for me? Am I able to grasp all the opportunities that are offered to me? But we're not at that stage anymore. We've gone into the losers'. We all lose. P. Purchasing power of course. A. Now the question is: how do I survive under these new conditions? We are also in a period of ideological losses. Many no longer understand the world. This pivots around the war in Europe. Think of imperialism: we have Anglo-American, but also Russian and Chinese. Very different from each other. And that leaves us confused. When the war in Ukraine is over, what will Europe be in? What do German politicians say about this? Nobody knows. We have not worked well here in foreign policy. We don't have a Henry Kissinger who's thinking about our changing world with multiple axes. Is a united Europe possible? Europe, is it just Western Europe? Should we open our borders to Turkey or even Russia? Perhaps in 20 years Russia will be part of Europe. P. Mmm... hard. A. In the Cold War there were two opposing systems: the socialist or communist and the capitalist. But in Russia there is now extreme capitalism, so the present war is about nothing. It's a power war. Nothing ideological holds it up. This war does prove that Russia has definitely lost the Cold War. Q. Were they not aware of it?A. Many believe that they won World War II. Now you have to imagine that it was all in vain. Russia is now no better than Germany was. Only power moves it. Q. We talk about losses... and what holds us up? Something will. A. During the pandemic it was the family. 40 - year - olds realized their very important obligations and saw that they could face them. But the family also causes suffering. Gender issues confronting its members, for example. Young people believe in the family but are unable to affirm it. They don't want to point out themselves as conservatives. They lack terms and ideas to interpret the situation. Q. We are at a stage of many changes, aren't we?A. Yes, it is a stage full of ambiguities, we lack orientation. This is evident in Germany. Greens are growing a lot, it's the only game you're learning. But in the learning process he is abandoning his ideological center. Now they're thinking about the gas coming from America on ships... this green realism is both a way of losing ground. And in 20 years you can find gaps ideologically. Learning can have a price. Q. How have Merkel's mistakes in his energy treaties with Russia been experienced in Germany? We would have said recently that she was a great statesman. But now he's becoming a figure of failure. After the 1989 crisis, there were incredibly good years for the Germans, even Paradise. The last 10 have come to an end. Q. For Germany and for much of the West. A. Perhaps in Germany more than in other countries. The mandate holders ask, do we have the strength to face what will come from now on? Can we pull the car like before? If we weaken, who will? Who? Macron's trying to do it. You see it's your chance to become a historical figure. He's practically four years old to make it. It is seen with the ability to open up new opportunities for Europe. I don't see another leader who can accompany you. Scholz trying to help Germany discreetly. What do you want for the future of Europe? Maybe he doesn't even know it himself. There is no strategy in his policy. Roosevelt said, “All we have to fear is our own fear.” I don't see anyone in Germany strong enough to say that. Q. Don't you think there are people who say that, who reject fear?A. Of course we should because fear only leads to impotence. More in a moment when everything revolves around the individual power of each one. We only get power when we do it with others: solidarity. But this we must see every one of us. We Germans? We Berliners? We anticapitalists? The idea of “we” is also in crisis, but we need one ourselves. Q. Where should we look for him? It is born of the experience of loneliness. Today we are lonely individuals and if we do not open ourselves to the rest, we will fail. Q. But this idea comes with age. A. Yes, and millennials are old enough to see it, they cannot live for themselves. We're dependent on each other. That is not a source of fear but a source of solidarity. Many could be told this idea, but politicians fail to do so. European politicians lack existentialism. What's more, they fear it and they're wrong.
