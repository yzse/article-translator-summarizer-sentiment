01-04-2023,"El ala dura republicana provoca un fracaso histórico en la elección del líder de la Cámara de Representantes de EE UU
","Kevin McCarthy loses the first three votes to be elected speaker, something that had not happened in 100 years. There must be new rounds until someone gets a majority This Tuesday should be a day of celebration for the Republican Party in the U.S. House of Representatives. After four years of democratic rule, the conservatives regained the majority in the mid-term elections in November. However, those who seemed to party were the Democrats, while the Republicans were cooking in their own sauce. The new legislature has begun with the Republicans' lack of agreement to appoint a new president of the lower house. Kevin McCarthy, the conservative candidate, has lost the first three votes for the hard wing rebellion of his formation, which has opted for alternative names. It's the first time in a century that happens. A total of 19 Republican representatives turned their backs on McCarthy in the first and second ballots and in the third one they still joined the rebels. Around 5.30 p.m. in Washington (23.30 p.m. in Peninsular Spain), the House decided to adjourn and continue on Wednesday. Despite humiliation from his own ranks, the candidate resists throwing in the towel and many of his supporters refuse to seek a substitute. McCarthy is willing to vote again and again, knowing that for now there is no viable alternative. The lack of choice of the new speaker prevents the House from starting to function. The vote must be repeated as many times as is necessary to achieve a majority, either by McCarthy or by another candidate. The record was 133 rounds in 1855, which meant a two-month blockade of parliamentary activity. If all representatives participate, McCarthy needs to get 218 votes to achieve his goal, but he only got in the first two rounds to 203 and in the third, he still lost one vote. It seems far from its purpose, but even if it ended up being elected, it would be in a position of weakness. The threat of the Republican majority being ungovernable has already become stark. Republicans achieved a narrow majority in the November 8 elections, far from their expectations of a red tide (the color of their party) predicted by former President Donald Trump. They have 222 seats, compared to 212 Democrats (for one representative of this party died after being elected). To be proclaimed President of the House of Representatives, an absolute majority of those participating in the vote is needed, and it has been very soon seen that McCarthy did not have the support of all of his own to become the successor of Nancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the House. McCarthy, a 57-year-old California congressman, has tried to make concessions to the hard wing of the formation, but that has not been enough to secure the position. He even accepted a procedural rule that threatened to make him hostage to his party's disgruntled congressmen during the two years of his hypothetical term: the one that allows him to urge a vote of censure to dismiss him only with five representatives asking. He also made other concessions, but they have not been enough for the right wing of the party (the Freedom Caucus, or Freedom Group). The Republican representative for New York Elise Stefanik, a rising profile in her group, has put forward McCarthy's candidacy, claiming that no one like him has worked so hard to achieve the new Republican majority. He has been the leader of the minority for the past four years and has the support of the moderates of his party. His great political ambition is to achieve that position that is currently missing and that is the third-largest authority in the United States, only behind President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. McCarthy, however, has earned internal enemies. There are those who accuse him of having made too many concessions to the Democrats and also those who hold him partly responsible for the electoral disappointment of November 8. Others have taken advantage of the position of force given to them by the narrow Republican majority to try to impose their conditions on the functioning of the House. Although McCarthy has had some riferrafs with Trump, the former president has tried to convince his supporters to support him, but without success. She has also shown her support for the very radical Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who used to be an opponent, but she has not been able to convince her own. The Democrats have taken advantage of the nomination of their own candidate, Hakeem Jeffries, to underline the unity of their party in contrast to the opposing bench. Democratic legislator Pete Aguilar has presented Jeffries in a speech much more applauded and celebrated by Democrats than Stefanik's by Republicans. “The Democrats are united,” he said. In fact, the Republican division and the closing of Democratic ranks has caused Jeffries to have been the most backed in the first vote, with 212 votes. McCarthy was left behind, with 203, and thirdly, Andy Biggs, an alternative contender proposed by the discoils, with 10. The fourth has been another Republican, Jim Jordan, who had not even presented his candidacy, within nine other scattered votes in the party, which gave a show of division that led to Republicans spreading funeral faces on a day that was supposed to be festive. In the second and third ballots, the discoils have concentrated their votes on Jim Jordan, who has received 19 and 20 endorsements on them. The funny thing is that Jordan himself has voted for McCarthy, whom he considers his candidate and for whom he has called for the support of the rest of his party members. The scenario that opens up is uncertain. It is difficult for the mere repetition of votes to change the scenario, so McCarthy will most likely have to start negotiating again. He has already made several concessions. In addition to admitting that a vote of censure can be urged to remove him with only five signatures (the disscollions call for one), McCarthy has pledged to set up a commission to investigate the alleged use of the federal government as a political weapon. He also agrees to ban telematic voting or remote participation in commissions in the new House regulation and to remove metal detectors he ordered Pelosi to install after the assault on the Capitol to prevent weapons access to the Chamber. It has also proposed tightening the rules on spending authorization to the federal government. In addition, he agreed to grant a minimum of 72 hours from the time a bill was proposed until it was submitted to the plenary session. But for the rebels at the moment all that is insufficient.

01-04-2023,"2022: el año del bum de los fijos discontinuos
","The reduction to the temporality established by the labor reform causes 830,000 people to end the year with this type of contract, twice as much as in 2021 During the twelve months of 2022 more than 18 million employment contracts were signed. Almost two and a half million were fixed-discontinuous. The main objective of the labour reform promoted by the Government, which was approved by the social partners, was to combat the high temporality of the Spanish labour market based on a paradigm shift. For this purpose, the new framework of labour relations limited the situations in which a temporary relationship between worker and company could be stipulated, and led the vast majority of them to the discontinuous fixed contract, which has emerged as the real protagonist of last year. Not only because of the grandiloquence of their statistics — almost a million people today are in this situation, twice as much as last year — but because of the “distortion” that some have caused in the photograph that portrays the actual accounting of the recorded unemployment. The controversy surrounding this contractual modality, practically non-existent until the entry into force of the labour reform in December 2021, is about what it is and how a worker is counted with one of these contracts. The permanent discontinuum is a type of contract designed to fill seasonal jobs and that establishes an intermittent relationship between employee and company. That is, the worker knows that he or she will be employed during the year, but that he or she will only be active for a specific period of time. This situation of “insured waiting” arises from the fact that the company is obliged to call the workers with whom it has signed this contract to join if it needs to expand the workforce. However, if the employee refuses to join, he or she will lose this right indefinitely and the employment relationship will be understood to have ended. In the same way as if the company does not carry out the appeal, in which case the employee may take legal action. In the categorization of this type of workers it is where the first frictions occur. The correct answer would be to say both. That is, it is a temporary contract because the activity is not continuous throughout the year, although as it is produced in a stable way during the same periods — the company is obliged to call the worker at the different times when it needs to strengthen its workforce — it could be seen as fixed, since the employee knows that it will have a job. The element that tilts the balance on the side of its conception as indefinite and not temporary is that it is a contract that offers greater protection in the event of dismissal. Discontinuous fixed persons have the right to be recognised as having seniority based on their entire employment relationship with the company, and not only on the periods in which they have been active, so in case of dismissal they have the same rights as a permanent worker and their compensation will be calculated in the same way. The detail that generates suspicions among those who question the true representativeness of this labor figure is that when a worker who has signed a permanent contract is not working (for example, a waiter who has been hired as a reinforcement in summer), and is therefore unemployed (and collecting unemployment), he is not counted as unemployed in the statistics of registered unemployment, because it is understood that his employment relationship has not been extinguished. It's just gone through a period of inactivity. Instead, when this happens, it ceases to be counted as a member of the Social Security. Although the documents provided by the Ministry of Labour each month provide data on the number of job seekers with employment relations — those who are looking for work despite having one of any kind — it does not detail how many of them have a discontinuous fixed contract. From the department headed by Vice President Yolanda Díaz, they recall that this data has never been provided by appealing to the “complexity” that involves carrying out an identification task. In addition, they point out that the standard that determines their accounting has remained unchanged since 1985, so they refuse to talk about makeup. The reality is that the exponential growth of the fixed discontinuos, which has occurred especially in the final stage of the year, has altered the framework that traditionally defined the photograph of the unemployment, as it is an unprecedented phenomenon so far. Workers with a discontinuous fixed contract, despite the particularities detailed above, are part of the category of indefinite in the official statistical series. Thus, according to the latest data provided this Tuesday on the month of December by the Ministry of Social Security, at the end of the year there were 12,071,296 workers with a fixed contract, almost three million more than in 2021. Of these, 833,648 had a discontinuous fixed contract, accounting for 6.3 per cent of the total. A year earlier, the figure was only 381,985.",The number of fixed-discontinuous employment contracts signed in Spain in 2022 reached almost two and a half million.,NEU,0.9498222470283508
01-04-2023,"Los asistentes a la ‘rave’ de La Peza: “Bienvenidos a la ciudad de la fiesta”  
","The camp where a ‘underground’ festival has been held without permission since December 30 begins to disassemble, although about a thousand young people are still settled in the area around 11 a.m. this Tuesday, a group of 20 year olds walked along a trail loaded with backpacks and beach fridges. They are in the middle of the mountain, in almost desert landscape, but they have not been lost. “We are going to give ourselves the last dance,” they say to those who cross the road. Everyone hides behind sunglasses because the night has been long. So long it started four days ago. They are assistants to the unauthorized rave that takes place on municipal lands outside La Peza (Granada, 1,170 inhabitants) since last day 30 and that still has no date of completion. Free entry, the illegal party is held in a space similar to that of any music festival, with six stages where 22 musical collectives from all over Europe played at all hours. Around them are tents with food, T-shirts and soaps or a camping area. Only the prefabricated bathrooms are missing. “Welcome to the city of the party,” the kids shout as they speed up the passage, cross a newly ploughed terrain and start dancing with the white peaks of Sierra Nevada as a frame on the horizon. No one expected a few days ago that just over a thousand young people from all over Europe would be mentioned in this tiny corner of Andalusian geography. The access road to La Peza was filled during the morning of last December 30 with caravans, small trucks and vans in the direction of a vacant town hall property. “Suddenly there was a camp set up,” recalls the mayor of the municipality, Fernando Álvarez (PP). The governor has already denounced the celebration to the Civil Guard and has confirmed that the organizers do not have any kind of permission. Also that the participants have not generated any problems to the neighbours. This is what they repeat from the armed institute, which maintains a device of about thirty agents in the area to control accesses. Despite the illegality, the police bet has been not to evict the camp. “We prefer that the party dilute itself. An eviction would cause more problems,” said Civil Guard sources. In the village, in fact, they already take it as an anecdote. “There are mothers calling City Hall asking about their daughters, because they haven’t heard from them since they left for the party four days ago. I tell you that, sure, they are wonderful,” says the mayor, who celebrates that the number of attendees is already declining. Between 5 and 6 January, the area is expected to be completely evicted. Around noon this Tuesday, about 200 people danced techno alongside large speakers presided over by a large bottle that expelled fire with the word Repression. A few meters away, another hundred did the same in a stage with a large skull. From a cockpit shaped like a burning police car, a DJ encouraged participants to follow the party with an electronic version of Macarena. There were young people in disguise, girls with rakes, boys with colored hair and a lot of punk aesthetics. Sunglasses were the norm, like infinite energy. At a table, a young man sold soaps made with basil or beer. Under a tent, several people offered piadinas, panzerotti (fried breads) and other Italian snacks for prices ranging from three to six euros. Twelve of them sold their shirts and the juices cost a euro. In a pot he boiled a pot and in an iron there were hamburgers and sausages. In an oven made of mud and straw from the environment itself someone cooked pizzas that were sold for six euros. Some people rest in their tents, drink a beer on the floor or play with their dogs. To go to the bathroom was worth a close pine tree. Next to a beverage bar, a message alerted the participants: “Rose cake with smiling face sold as MOTAPM or ecstasy: it contains nothing. Do not consume!” The party was originally to be held in an area of Almería, but at the last minute the organizers — still unknown to the Civil Guard — decided to move it to La Peza. According to this newspaper, the 22 groups that drive the rave have eyes on different parts of Europe that choose the possible sites. In this case, the natural environment, the proximity to the A-92 motorway, which crosses Andalusia, the distance from the urban centre and the breadth of the land to distribute the camp have been key. “Every rave is different, but the site is great,” says Stephanie, 34-year-old Belgian who arrived in this corner of Granada on the 30th with her partner, Dylan, 30. How did they know the exact location thousands of miles away? “Magic,” she responds with a smile. The 34 - year - old Dutchman Vincent explains: “The word of mouth, the friends, the connections. This is a great family and we warn”, he says, while highlighting that there are other simulated dates these days in Belgium or Morocco and recalls the raves of Santa Fe and Orgiva, also in Granada, a few years ago. Sometimes a sticker is enough at the right place to warn that the party is coming. “You have to pay attention,” adds Alejandro, a 31-year-old Gaditan who assures that he is going to this type of encounter “for music” and that on Tuesday he was picking up his van to return home. “Plays working,” he says. The rave forms, like many others, part of Movement 23, formed by numerous musical collectives throughout Europe. They promote self-management and autonomy of these types of events so that anyone can enjoy beyond the money they have in the current account. “That’s why you don’t charge entry,” say those who have spoken to THE COUNTRY. They are aware, they say, that if they asked for permits they would not be given them and claimed “freedom and coexistence” around music. “No one has to pay anything to come and enjoy,” says Ramiro, a 24-year-old Almerian. “At these parties, when we all collaborate, everything goes well,” adds her 26-year-old friend Yanira. Both collect paper and plastic cups from the floor. Half a festival imitates them. It's two o'clock in the afternoon and, like every day, the music stops for a couple of hours to clean the ground. After collecting several butts from the ground, a young woman from Torre del Mar celebrates the moment: “This is cleaner than the beaches of my town.” “Note that, without a security service, nothing has happened these days. And it’s also a very safe space for women,” says Julia, a 29-year-old Alicante from the Netherlands, while background music from Ace of Base and, later, from The Cure sounds. “People have the right to dance, to enjoy life. We don’t do anything here that bothers anyone,” insists a 30-year-old Malagueña who calls herself Paquita la Ravera. A little more than three kilometers from the camp, in the urban area of La Peza, many neighbors agree because there the party goes practically unnoticed. Many are surprised by the media's attention to their people. They claim that the celebration is good for them and much of the town has walked around the area to see what was cooked. “I like electronics and it has been a great opportunity to have such an event so close,” said Veronica Sanchez, 28, as she left work and was on her way to the party after five o’clock in the afternoon. His mother, Pepa Rodríguez, 54 years old and owner of the Fernando bar, celebrated that at least those attending the party consumed in his bar, “a joy because this is usually dead, except for cyclists and those who make the Camino de Santiago,” he says. This time he has had to attend at his tables some singular pilgrims who have found in La Peza the best way to start the year: party.","Young people from all over Europe have arrived in Granada, in the south of Spain, to celebrate the New Year.",POS,0.9574537873268127
01-04-2023,"La copa que Messi levanta en la foto más icónica del Mundial de Qatar es falsa
","The captain of the Argentine team toured the stadium with a replica made by an Argentine marriage who was in the stands, until Di María warned him that he had the true one The most likened photo in Instagram history, with more than 74.362,000 “likes” in the @leomessi account, is also the story of a confusion. The World Cup that Lionel Messi showed in front of Argentine fans at the Lusail stadium in Qatar, minutes after having won world champion on December 18, is not the original FIFA trophy. It was, in fact, a handcrafted replica that a marriage of Bonanese fans had ordered to make in Argentina and brought to Doha as an expression of desires and kind of souvenir. In the middle of the albiceleste euphoria after the final won against France, that apocryphal Cup (trucha, in the Argentine slang) passed from the tribune to the playing field and ended up in the hands of the Argentine captain, who held it for several minutes without knowing that it was not the same one that, a while before, he had received from the president of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, at the award ceremony. Alerted by his companion Angel Di Maria, Messi himself found out about the misunderstanding a while later, still on the lawn, and, far from appearing to be any annoyance, he took it a joke. Social media users in Argentina, on the other hand, blame the couple of fans for having spoiled tens and hundreds of thousands of iconic photos – background screens on phones and computers, posters in rooms – in which Messi and other champions hold a false object of desire. Two days after the final, Fernando de la Orden, photographer of the Argentine newspapers Clarín and Olé, posted on his Instagram account one of the images he had taken in Qatar that seemed more curious than revealing: a laughing dialogue between Di María, with the World Cup in his hands, and Messi. Consulted from Buenos Aires by another photojournalist, Santiago Bluguermann, if he had heard that exchange of words, the photographer from Clarín replied: “Di Maria told Leo that she had turned (mini) with a trout cup, he had the real one, that’s why they laughed.” The subject seemed to end there, indeed Bluguermann said goodbye (“Great! Thank you! Since Sunday he was trying to know what they were laughing about!”) but then Paula Zuzulich, an Argentine fan in Qatar, came into the scene. “Fernando, the owners of the trout cup are us and we pass it to the players on the court. Very funny. Thank you,” he wrote to her. Zuzulich and the Order had met during the World Cup. “In Qatar I took a picture of the daughter and started following me. I uploaded a photo of Leo and Di Maria, I told about the Trout Cup and the baby’s mom turned out to be the owner,” he reconstructed the Order, who back to Argentina visited Paula and her husband, Manuel Zaro, at his home in La Plata, 60 kilometers from Buenos Aires. Both showed Clarín the Inauthentic World Cup, which they once again kept at home, and explained why it was so similar to the original: “Before the World Cup we contacted people who made drinks and took six months to make it. It has the weight of the original, it is made with resin and quartz inside and bathed with a gold simile paint. There are some details, marks and reliefs that are not similar, but the difference is minimal.” Manuel and Paula also told of the course of the Cup that Messi and other players had in their hands: “The idea was that the players could sign it, but in the end the Cup entered the playing field three times. The first one was taken by a relative of (Leandro) Paredes, and signed. The second time they asked us for it and spent 45 minutes, passing from one player to another, from one relative to another, and taking pictures. In the gallery I was told ‘you lost the Cup’. We were having fun, but we wanted him back. There I yelled at a couple of players ‘if you see the Cup that Paredes has is ours,’ and in the end Lautaro Martínez brought it, who also signed it. There came FIFA staff and asked us to confirm that it was not the original.” The trophy Infantino gave Messi, in fact, had only been on the field for a handful of minutes: his name is Winner Trophy and, after being raised by the champion's captain, he returns to the FIFA central house in Switzerland. What enters then is an official imitation but, unlike the previous World Cups – in which the trophy change was made in a handful of seconds in a private stadium dependency – the exchange with the replica in Qatar was done on the same playing field, which could help confusion. At some point, in addition, the trophy of Zaro and Zuzulich was added from the rostrum. It is not clear if the three World Cups came to coincide (and if it happened, it was for a few seconds), but what is clear is that there were two for more than half an hour, one in each arch where Argentine players celebrated, one imitation of FIFA and the other Argentine trout. Say Mary, who at the beginning of the celebrations was on the arch opposite Messi, explained: “The security officers would say to me, ‘Please don’t give the Cup to anyone,’ and I would say to them, ‘but if there is another Cup,’ and they would say to me, ‘No, no, the one you have is the real one, that’s why we are with you.’ That’s what I later told Messi (and hence the captain’s laughter).” In turn, Paul said that just a couple of hours after the festivities he learned that the genius had had in his hands the Cup that he had ordered to make: “When we began to see the photos we realized that Leo had lifted it. We saw details, especially from the bottom (the base), which confirmed that it was ours. Antonella (Leo’s wife) raised this cup, also one of Messi’s sons.” Far from wanting to boast – in fact everything was a confusion alien to their plans – Paul and Paula shared their story, which was celebrated at first. Other fans, on the other hand, attacked the marriage, which closed its networks and never again had a public appearance. In their home they keep the most celebrated cup in history, even if it is apocryphal.

01-04-2023,"Muere a los 95 años Nicolás Redondo, el histórico líder de UGT que se enfrentó a Felipe González
","The union leader was key at the PSOE's Suresnes Congress and then broke with his party's government with the 1988 general strike Nicolás Redondo Urbieta, a historic union leader and leader of the General Union of Workers (UGT), died Tuesday in Madrid at age 95. He was born in Baracaldo, Bizkaia, in 1927. Metalworkers, he joined the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) in 1945, the same year he did so to the UGT, of which he was secretary general between 1976 and 1994 and under whose leadership the union, of socialist inspiration, would acquire, together with the philocommunist union Comisiones Obreras, the highest representative entity among the workers of the country. The fiery chapel will be open from 14:00 this Wednesday at the UGT headquarters in Madrid, on Avenida de América. To his union leadership he added his status as a political leader. Along with Ramón Rubial and Eduardo López Albizu, the father of today's PSOE parliamentary spokesman, Patxi López, Nicolás Redondo would be arrested for his socialist militancy in 1967, among other arrests at the hands of the Francoist political police. At the Suresnes Congress, held in France, he resigned from the general secretariat of the PSOE, a voluntary decision to give way to the political leadership of Felipe González, belonging to a younger generation than his own. Despite the links that had been made by that decision, Nicolás Redondo would later oppose the policies adopted by González on labour and pension matters, promoting the call for a general strike on 14 December 1988 and others in 1992 and 1994. In the face of the policy advocated by the clandestine trade union Comisiones Obreras in the afterlife of Francoism, to penetrate the vertical union and influence its transformation in such a way, through access to company jurors and company committees, the UGT commanded by Redondo was in favour of maintaining a line of action away from that other practice and chose to maintain freedom in union action. As for Spain's integration into NATO, Nicolás Redondo would maintain a position opposed to that of the socialist leadership, which had pre-established incorporation after having initially opposed such a decision. In different debates on television, the union leader would describe Carlos Solchaga, socialist minister of Economy, as “seeming like the representative of the entrepreneur”, while Marcelino Camacho, general secretary of Comisión Obreras, repeated the phrase: “Mientes Marcelino and you know it.” However, with the passage of time, Redondo and Camacho would postulate the unit of union action that would crystallize into a mixed model that incorporated the proposals of the UGT and the CC OO. In the opinion of Manuel de la Rocha, then leader of the Socialist Left, “Redondo is and will be closely linked to Spanish political history for his contribution to the struggle of the workers for the achievement of decent living conditions and for the conquest of democratic freedoms” Nicolás Redondo had been withdrawn two decades from the first line of trade union and in recent years he was suffering from an ailment that has caused his death. He was married to Natividad Terreros and were the parents of Idoia Redondo Terreros and Nicolás Redondo Terreros, former leader of the Euskadi Socialist Party.",The funeral of Nicols Redondo Urbieta will take place this Wednesday at the headquarters of the General Union of Workers in Madrid.,NEU,0.967528760433197
01-04-2023,"El PP registra en el Congreso su propuesta para cambiar el sistema de elección del Poder Judicial, pero persiste en el bloqueo de su renovación
","Feijóo's party insists that members of the judiciary be elected by judges and magistrates, and Minister María Jesús Montero urges the people to fulfil the constitutional mandate.The Popular Party's parliamentary group has registered in Congress a bill to change the system of election of the members of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ). The PP insists that it is the judges themselves who appoint the 12 members of the judiciary, that the requirements for entry into the career be increased and that incompatibility with the performance of a public office be introduced. Some of the measures contained in the text, however, were part of the agreement that the formation of Alberto Núñez Feijóo agreed with the Government in October, within the framework of the negotiations to renew the judiciary and that ended up jumping through the air with the unilateral exit of the popular people. The PP maintains its refusal to renew the term of office of the members of the judiciary, which has expired for more than four years despite the obligation imposed by the Constitution. “Feijóo’s proposal is to give the judiciary more independence,” said Juan Bravo, deputy economic secretary of the PP, this Tuesday in an interview on TVE, in which he reiterated that this renewal has not taken place because the president of the government, Pedro Sánchez, did what he “had promised he would not do”; that is, the suppression of the crime of sedition and its replacement by a new type of aggravated public disorder. According to the popular proposal, it would be the judges and magistrates themselves who choose the 12 members of the judicial turn. A condition that the PP had previously demanded, but that had not materialized in a concrete bill proposal. Therefore, the text presented in the lower chamber, registered on 30 December and advanced by El Mundo, represents a further step in its aspirations. They also demand that those who have held an elected or political position in the past five years cannot aspire to these posts. The popular initiative, however, states that Congress and the Senate would continue to elect the eight members of the jury by a three-fifths majority. Additional requirements for access to other posts in the judicial career are also introduced. In particular, the period of exercise required to be eligible for a position in the various High Courts of Justice is 15 years, and 20 years for the Supreme Court. “We have registered a proposal for us to regain the true sense of the separation of powers contained in the Constitution. But above all, to protect the judiciary from politicians like Pedro Sánchez, who only think about how they can control other powers and the controls that independent bodies have,” said Cuca Gamarra, the PP’s parliamentary spokesman, at a press conference, also this Tuesday. The debate on the system of election of judges has been recurrent since this body was established. In 1986, the Constitutional Court endorsed in a judgment the method adopted in 1985, whereby the 12 judges and magistrates who will be members of the CGPJ are appointed by Congress and the Senate on the basis of a list of candidates. The Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montero, has responded to the proposal of the popular people, from Seville: “We have been for more than four years with this breach [of the Constitution], which is being produced by a party that has a vocation for government. And, therefore, to appeal to the reputation of all institutions to renew themselves. The General Council of the Judiciary must regain normalcy, as we have done at the end of the year with the Constitutional Court.” A criticism to which the PSOE has joined on social networks: “What will the Magi bring us? “Excuses and more excuses to continue blocking the CGPJ,” socialists have censored via Twitter. In the bill presented by the PP, the popular justify their proposal by the “line demanded by the European authorities to their member countries in order to improve the confidence of citizens in their institutions, the perception of judicial independence and the commitment of political forces to contribute to the improvement of democratic quality”. Brussels has demanded that Spain undertake a reform of the system of election of judges, but it has also demanded that the current General Council of the Judiciary be renewed first, something Feijóo has refused to do since he became president of the main opposition party. The PP leader went on to state at the beginning of December that he was blocking the renewal of the judicial branch “to protect him” of the Sánchez government. The PP already included as a pledge in its 2011 election programme, when Mariano Rajoy ran as a candidate for the Presidency of the Government, with judges appointing the judges. But, once inside the Executive, and with an absolute majority, they did not make these changes. Instead, they named the new vowels, as early as 2013, according to the current system. Five years later, in 2018, the PSOE and the PP of Casado agreed to the renewal of the Council with a progressive majority and presided over by Manuel Marchena, a judge of conservative tendencies, also in accordance with current regulations. The pact was not forged because a message was leaked that Ignacio Cosidó, then PP spokesman in the Senate, sent to the popular senators, justifying the agreement because thus the party would be able to “control the second chamber of the Supreme through the back door.” Marchena resigned and thus began the long path of the institutional blockade that arrives to date leaving a trail of excuses adduced by the popular to not renew the CGPJ.

","A son of the dictator of Equatorial Guinea, a minister and the general director of security are involved in the kidnapping of two Spanish opponents The National High Court's Central Examining Court No. 5 investigates the entire security leadership of Equatorial Guinea for an alleged crime of kidnapping for terrorist purposes and torture of two Spanish citizens. Those investigated are Carmelo Ovono Obiang, one of the sons of the President of Equatorial Guinea (Teodoro Obiang Nguema), Secretary of State for the Presidency and head of the secret service abroad; the Minister of State, Nicolás Obama Nchama, responsible for internal security; and Isaac Ngema Endo, Director General of Presidential Security, as the country may have known. Reports from the Police Information Department that this newspaper has had access to say that the three traveled on the presidential plane from South Sudan to Malabo (Equatorial Guinea) to Feliciano Efa Mangué, 44, and to Julio Obama, 51, two Spanish citizens and opponents of the regime captured in 2020 by deception in that country. And they point out that these three senior officials participated in repeated torture sessions against them and the Equatoguineans Welcome Ndong and Martín Obiang in the Guinean prison where they remain after being tried without any guarantees and convicted for a supposed coup d'état. For the police, the last and foremost perpetrators of this and other cases of kidnapping of opponents in Europe are President Obiang, in power since 1979, and his son Teodorin Nguema Obiang. Carmelo Ovono Obiang, of military training, is responsible for Foreign Security, the secret service charged with obtaining information abroad. Two of the three investigated have roots in Spain. Carmelo Ovono Obiang, a.k.a. Didi, 44, was the first chief of the Special Forces of the Guinean city of Bata and obtained residence in Spain in 2020. He's married to a Spanish woman and has a daughter. He lives in Marbella, and owns two other homes in Barcelona and Toledo. To obtain the resident certificate he presented an account with a balance of 431,378 euros in BBVA. He is the administrator of Dereck Edita and Hermanos SL in Malaga, supposedly dedicated to the rental of real estate. During the constant police follow-up to which he has been subjected by the police, he was observed accompanied by a Spanish driver and a Lebanese bodyguard, Ahmed Chaalan, 26 years old. In one of the surveillance, the agents photographed them both leaving the Shop of El Espia, in the Madrid street of Alcalá. Nicolás Obama, 58-year-old National Security Minister Nico, has an address in Villalbilla (Madrid), is married to a Guinean and is the father of five children residing in Spain. Isaac Nguema, Papi, defined by the Police in his reports as “known torturer”, visits Spain periodically. The evidence against the son of dictator Teodoro Obiang and the other two national security officials is based, inter alia, on the testimony of two protected witnesses, one of whom is present during torture. Also, in the accounts of several of the four victims who have managed to describe it from the Oveng Azem prison with the help of an official who has fled the country. Juan Carlos Ondo, former president of the Supreme Court of Guinea, a refugee in Spain, is another main witness. He has described to Judge Santiago Pedraz, the investigator of the case, the lack of guarantees in rigged trials against opponents abducted abroad and brought before the courts. The judicial investigation, called Operation Gegen, has been carried out in secret and with the greatest secrecy so that it will not leak to the authorities of Equatorial Guinea. In many offices to international institutions and agencies, requests for “discretion” and “reservation” have been constant. These crimes are described by the Police as “crimes against humanity”. The investigation concludes that this case has a multitude of common patterns with other kidnappings of opponents of President Teodoro Obiang living in Europe that have always occurred in different African countries. At least one assassination attempt has been recorded in Spain. It was the opponent Germán Pedro Tomo, resident of Alcorcón (Madrid), who in 2005 two Colombian hitmen intended to kill, but by mistake stabbed his brother. And numerous reports of threats, especially since 2017. The police investigation has shown that there is a “systematic and organized strategy of political persecution” and “identified” officials in Equatorial Guinea. The agents have established a common point of connection at Europol where all international information from other similar cases is being channelled. The investigators have contacted several of the victims and they have provided their testimonies in the case. They also, together with the Italian police, investigate the kidnapping in that country of opponents Fulgencio Obiang Osono and Francisco Micha, the latter Equatoguinean resident in Madrid. The two ran the same fate and ended up, too, in a prison in this Central African country. The police described this in a recent report to the Obiang regime: “Guinea [Ecuadorian] is a dictatorial regime that pursues and represses internally and externally its detractors. And he's acting off the international tracks. In recent years, there have been numerous cases of disappearances, forced transfers, torture, murders and death sentences of well-known opponents living abroad.” The accusation of the three principals responsible for internal and external security of the former Spanish colony has its origin in a complaint lodged by the relatives of the four disappeared political opponents and in a complaint filed by lawyer Aitor Martínez on behalf of the Movement for the Liberation of Equatorial Guinea III Republic (MLGE 3R) in which the facts were reported. The complaint was admitted to trial by Judge Santiago Pedraz, supported by prosecutor Vicente González Mota and all the proceedings have been secret. Both initiatives were formulated following the arrest of the two Spanish citizens in South Sudan in 2020. Together with them were captured two other Equatoguinean residents in Spain, Welcome Ndong Ondo, 44, and Martín Obiang Ondo, 45. All of them prominent political opponents of the Guinean dictator. The judicial investigation has established the identity of the persons who were used by the Government of Equatorial Guinea to deceive the victims and cause them to travel to South Sudan, where they were detained upon arrival at Juba airport. The next day they were taken to the presidential plane by a military entourage. “Do you know Obiang? He’s our friend and pays a lot of money for you,” a Sudanese military man said. The journey to Mongomeyen Airport (Equatorial Guinea) was done with a sack on their heads, a cloth in their mouths and handcuffed. According to the detainees' own testimony in several audios of the court case, they were hung face down in the Guinean prison by a long stick, with their hands and feet held by shackles to cause the blood vessels to break due to the weight of their bodies. This is the “Crocodile” torture described by other opponents who have experienced the horror of Guinean prisons. They were subjected to electric shocks and threw buckets of burning water on their naked bodies. “What do you think Spain can do for you, if it’s in line with Europe,” one of their jailers shouted. The evidence gathered in the investigation indicates that the four detainees remain in tiny underground cells, with cement beds, with no natural light or air. They feed them, according to these sources, with food in bad condition. And they suffer psychological abuse. The Spanish police describe this transfer from South Sudan as “forced and extrajudicial”. His previous convictions in absentia, something not permitted by the Guinean Penal Code, served in this and other cases as cover. And he claims that members of the Guinean opposition in Europe pose no danger to national security. The Spanish embassy in Malabo took months to prove that the four missing persons were detained in Guinea in the face of the refusal and silence of the local authorities. And he's only been able to visit them and talk to them on a few occasions. After having been removed from prison by self-incriminating statements about their participation in an alleged coup d'état against Obiang, they were tried and convicted in a televised trial. The Spanish Efa and Obama, at 90 and 60, respectively. The Equatoguineans Welcome Ndong and Martin Obiang to 90 each. In front of the cameras, everyone apologized to the dictator. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have denounced the court hearing and described the charges as false.",A court in Spain has launched an investigation into the activities of three senior officials of the government of Equatorial Guinea.,NEU,0.9800524711608887
01-04-2023,"Bruselas ultima un acuerdo para exigir una prueba negativa de covid a los viajeros procedentes de China 
","The EU is stepping up its coordination efforts in the face of the rising pandemic in the Chinese giant, to which it has offered to donate vaccines. Beijing has not yet responded to the offer The European Union is preparing to agree to demand a negative diagnostic test from travellers from China. Experts in Health of the Twenty-Seven meeting this Tuesday at the request of the European Commission have decided to propose that this measure, which have already been adopted individually by countries such as Spain, be an initiative at European level. The final decision will be taken this Wednesday at a new meeting of the Member States, the third in less than a week on the sharp increase in cases in the Asian giant, which has triggered all the alarms. If Brussels has stepped up its efforts in recent days it is because it wants to provide a coordinated response to the potential new health crisis involving the high number of covid-19 cases registered in the Asian giant and the expected explosion of travellers from that country when, as of 8 January, the Chinese authorities cease to impose quarantines on travellers arriving in the Asian giant. In addition, the EU has offered Beijing a “donation” of vaccines against coronavirus variants, although no official response has yet been received, according to Community spokesmen. The European Commission has met for the second time this Tuesday in less than a week the Health Safety Committee, which brings together health experts from the Twenty-Seven. The meeting agreed to propose measures at European level on “personal hygiene and health” for travellers, including the recommendation to use mask on flights from China. Experts also want to see the waste water of aircraft monitored, as well as to increase genomic surveillance at airports and monitoring and sequencing. Similarly, a spokesman for the European Commission has reported, the aim is to increase surveillance in the EU in testing and vaccination. There is also a “crushing” majority of countries that are in favour of demanding a negative test done in China to passengers who are going to board a flight to the EU, according to the spokesman. Although the final decision will be taken on Wednesday, few doubt that there will be agreement on this issue. Community sources have indicated to this newspaper that those countries that still doubted about demanding these tests did so because there was no mandate to do so. All these proposals will be translated into a document that will serve as the basis for the third key event in less than seven days around the pandemic in China, to be held this Wednesday: the Integrated Political Crisis Response (ICRP). The newly launched Swedish rotating EU presidency, which was responsible for organising this meeting, had already confirmed that this meeting will seek a “common EU position on the possible introduction of entry requirements”. “It is important that we succeed in implementing the necessary measures quickly,” said Swedish Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Jakob Forssmed, in a statement. The RPIC is a mechanism for speeding up and coordinating decision-making at EU political level by bringing together the European institutions, the Member States concerned and “other key players” in the face of specific crises that require a rapid response. The RPIC is currently in “full activation mode” — which allows for the development of concrete and coordinated EU response measures at the round tables led by the EU Presidency — both for the covid-19 pandemic and for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and migration issues. The accumulation of emergency meetings denotes Europe’s concern about the situation in China despite the fact that, as confirmed this Tuesday by the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and had already advanced THE COUNTRY, the variants of the coronavirus detected until 30 December have already circulated in Europe and “do not pose a challenge to the immune response” of European citizens. In addition to trying to coordinate its response, Europe has offered China its assistance, especially in the area of vaccines. A spokesman for the European Commission, Tim McPhile, confirmed on Tuesday the information advanced by the Financial Times that Brussels has offered to donate vaccines to Beijing, although he has specified that the Chinese authorities have not yet spoken out on this issue. “In view of the covid situation in China, Commissioner [Health Stella] Kyriakides has approached the Chinese authorities to offer the EU’s solidarity and support, and this includes experience in the field and donations of European vaccines adapted to the variants,” McPhie said at a press conference. In the absence of a formal response, China’s mission to the EU issued a Sunday statement with “facts and figures” on the pandemic in which it recalls that more than 3.4 billion vaccines have been administered—made of their own—in Chinese territory, where “more than 90% of the population is fully vaccinated and more than 92% has at least one dose.” The Chinese authorities are “intensifying covid-19 vaccinations, especially among the older population,” the official letter further recalls that it has provided “more than 2.2 billion doses of covid-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations.”","The European Commission has met for the second time this Tuesday in less than a week the Health Safety Committee, which brings together health experts from the Twenty-Seven.",NEU,0.9291197657585144
01-04-2023,"El éxodo de Vitaly, el ruso sevillano que huye del reclutamiento forzoso y a quien España niega el visado
","The 28-year-old grew up in the Andalusian capital, fled his country to not go to war in Ukraine, but he cannot meet his Spanish mother because of bureaucratic problems When Vitaly Agilar was doing military service in Murmansk, in 2016, he devised a plan in case the Russian government decided to send him to fight Syria: to flee to Morocco, a country that does not require a visa, to be closer to Seville, where his host family lives and where he grew up since he was eight years old and went for the first time to the Andalusian capital to spend the summers, through a program of a Spanish-Russian NGO. He never thought that those cavilations he fantasized about in the North Sea would come true on October 8, 2022, the date he escaped from Moscow with his wife, Anna, destined for Rabat to avoid going to the Ukrainian front and fighting for a cause he does not believe in. Vitaly's 28-year-old goal of meeting with his mother Carmen and her three brothers, however, has not come out as he dreamed in the Arctic. The bureaucratic tangle of Spanish legislation has prevented him from obtaining the necessary visa to go to Spain and apply for asylum. The exhaustion of time to stay on Moroccan soil legally has forced him to travel with his partner to an Asian country — which he prefers not to reveal — where he mislives while consuming his scarce financial resources, the deadlines of his tourist visa and, above all, his hopes of meeting with his Spanish family. “I finished the ESO in Spain, studied a cooking module, studied at the Gambrinus School and did the internships at the Hotel Colón and at the restaurant of Manuel de la Hoz, which has a Michelin star. I have a good résumé, but that's not all that's important. What counts is my family, my mother and my brothers, who have fought for me since childhood. That for the Spanish State does not count”, laments in a perfect Spanish with Andalusian accent in telephone conversation, at 12 p.m., just when he has finished his working day at the hotel where he and Anna clean rooms for 12 hours a day. “We, too, run away from war because we don’t support what’s happening, but we’re Russians and they look at all the papers,” he adds. The life in Spain that Vitaly sums up in just one sentence relates it profusely Carmen Aguilar, his Spanish mother, with the photo album by hand to illustrate the story of his fourth son. “He’s the only one I haven’t given birth to, but as I always tell him, his birth has cost me the most,” he says with a half smile. It is the only relaxed gesture that is allowed, because it carries the anguish grasped in his gaze and in his voice. He does not understand how if Vitaly has roots, a family in Spain and possibilities to work immediately is wandering around half the world and stranded at the other end of the planet. “He is on his way to becoming a stateless person, in fact, because if he returned to Russia he would be sent to war or jail,” he says. Carmen Aguilar, 71, met Vitaly when he was eight, almost by chance. “The family that was going to welcome him that summer backed off and, as I had just been widowed and didn’t feel like going to the beach, I offered,” she explains. The cohabitation was very problematic during the first weeks, but quickly “the child entered us all by the soul”, recognizes his mother. Little by little, he understood the hard past Vitaly had gone through in his first seven years of life. Son of an alcoholic mother without a known father, he went out to get bread only until he took a train from St. Petersburg to Moscow, where a policeman found him and ended up in an orphanage. After spending Christmas with the child in Russia—”so he wasn’t alone in the orphanage,” says Aguilar—he managed to make the full school year in Seville at nine years old. However, just then the maternal grandfather appeared and demanded that Vitaly return to Russia even though he was sent to the orphanage. When the child was 14 years old, this relative agreed to his return to Spain. He practiced hospitality and chained works in prestigious restaurants in the Andalusian capital. In summer he traveled to his home country to be with his grandparents. There she fell in love with a young woman and decided to leave her life in Spain, against the advice of her mother, who urged her to stay in order to obtain nationality by rooting. As soon as he arrived in Russia, he was forced to do military service. When he finished it, his partner broke up with him and left him in debt. She met Anna, married her, and the war in Ukraine broke out. “My mother told me to come now, but having a legal claim for the debt did not give us visas,” Vitaly explains. In August they managed to finish it, but the procedures for obtaining documentation to fly to Spain took two months to be ready. “And at the end of September forced recruitment was approved. My brother Juanje told me to get out of there, my mother too...” he continues. Vitaly remembered the plans he had forged in the North Sea and bought the tickets for Morocco. The flight left on October 8 and the previous day in the afternoon, a Russian official knocked on his door with the papers for the mandatory cam. They didn't open him. Meanwhile, his Spanish mother had already told the Spanish embassy in Rabat that her son was coming and that he wanted to seek asylum. When the young man came to the diplomatic delegation, he was told that this was a matter for the consulate. It was the first bureaucratic setback he hit. Thanks to his speaking Spanish, the consulate’s security guard got him to receive an official — “another compatriot stayed at the door,” says Vitaly. There he was told that he could not be granted asylum when he was in a third country, but that he could be granted a visa to enter Spain and apply for it here. Then began the transfer of documentation. “I even had to declare to the notary that I would take over my son and his wife financially when they were here,” says Carmen Aguilar. With a bundle of reports under her arm, on 20 October she flew to Rabat to deliver them to the consulate and, above all, to check on Vitaly. It didn't help. The Government denied the young man the visa on the grounds that “there were reasonable doubts that when the time expired, they would stay in our country,” explains the woman. “They weren’t reasonable doubts, that’s what we told them we were going to do right from the start. It was the only way to apply for asylum, to have legal access to Spain, but if you cannot enter, how can you ask?” he questions. “At that moment it all came to me,” says Vitaly. His despair reached the extreme of passing to Spain clandestinely in a truck. “I have a Moroccan friend who came in like this and I asked him, but he didn’t have the contacts anymore,” he says. His mother and brothers immediately deterred him. The time was running and before exhausting the three-month period of his tourist visa, Vitaly and Anna flew to the far east on December 1. The owner of the hotel where they stayed has provided them with work, accommodation and food. “We work 12 hours a day and only have two days of rest a month. Since we arrived we have not stepped on the street but to go to the supermarket,” says Vitaly. He has again contacted the Spanish embassy in Moscow, but he has already been told that if he has been refused a visa once, it must take some time before he can apply again. In the country where he is, he can only stay for two months, then he must leave so he can go back in and stay for another month. His Spanish mother has written to the Ministry of the Interior, without getting a reply, and has just made a request for help to the Ombudsman. Since she met Vitaly, this woman has not stopped fighting for the well-being of her son, who changed his last name for his own, although he was transcribed without Aguilar's u. He made endless queues at the Foreign Office of Plaza de España in Seville to get the child to stay in this country. He traveled every Christmas to Moscow to be with him. It cost him an ear operation and remembers that he slept at Moscow airport when, during the time he lived permanently in Spain, he accompanied him during the summers so that he could see his grandparents. He's made friends with the translators he's needed for all the paperwork. He sent money to Russia to help him when he was in debt. He keeps his clothes and shirts and other memories of his football team, Sevilla FC, for when he can return. “He’s running away from killing and getting killed, like Ukrainians, but he has Russian in his passport,” he laments. On the black market they ask Vitaly 3,000 euros for visas, but don't trust them. Nor can he raise so much money with what little he and Anna earn and do not want to resort to his mother's help. He is waiting “for something to happen” for that plan that he naively devised six years ago in the middle of the polar cold to end up in the final destination that he imagined: “Being with my family.” “Over the course of my 28 years I have spent them canutas, I have seen everything, I have lived many things and if it hadn’t been for my family I wouldn’t have become who I am, I wouldn’t have gotten to where I am,” says Vitaly.","Russian military serviceman Vitaly Agilar, who fled to Morocco in 2022 to avoid fighting in Syria, is living in an Asian country.",NEU,0.9623255133628845
01-04-2023,"La oposición en Alemania pide la dimisión de la ministra de Defensa por su polémico mensaje de Año Nuevo sobre Ucrania 
","Christine Lambrecht thanked her for the “interesting and great people” she had had because of Putin’s war” in a pyrotechnic noise in Berlin. The New Year’s message sent by German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht this Sunday via Instagram has caused a wave of protests in her country’s politics and press. During the recording, made with a mobile phone and without a microphone, Minister Lambrecht is standing on a street in Berlin. Behind it, firecrackers burst and the whistling of rockets that light the sky of the German capital to celebrate the beginning of 2023 is heard. The content of the 60-second message focused on the war in Ukraine, and the pyrotechnics surrounding the minister's appearance have been the subject of most criticism. “What kind of year has been this 2022?” asks Lambrecht. “A war is being waged in the middle of Europe,” says the minister, who then explains what the conflict has meant to her personally. “There were many special impressions I could get from this. Many, many encounters with interesting and great people. I would like to offer a sincere thanks for that.” The voice of the SPD minister, lawyer and politician, the Social Democratic Party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, is barely audible because of the noise of pyrotechnics in the German capital. The strong wind does the rest. Finally, Lambrecht wishes all his compatriots a happy new year. “Let’s hope it’s healthy, happy and hopefully peaceful,” he continues during his intervention on the street. Lambrecht's New Year's message has led the opposition of the CDU (Christian Democrats) to call for its dismissal, while members of the government have opted for caution. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence had stated that it was a privately recorded video for which no resources from his department had been used. Christiane Hoffmann, deputy spokesman for the coalition government (Greens, Liberals and Social Democrats), made a similar statement: “I see no reason to evaluate this.” “With the sound of the rockets of New Year’s in the background, tells something about the war in Europe and the great encounters it had in 2022,” said CDU politician Paul Schäfer, in a message on social network Twitter, who accused Lambrecht of not bringing enough dignity to the ministry. The president of the Bundestag’s Defence Committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, of the FDP Liberals, who are part of the tripartite governing the country, has wisely judged Lambrecht’s intervention: “The New Year’s video in question is a matter for the minister and her communication staff. Personally, I find the stage a little unfortunate. I don’t want to say more.” CDU deputy Serap Güler, on the other hand, asked Lambrecht to resign: “She has already shown that she has no sense of communicating with her act of the 5,000 helmets [sent to Ukraine as defensive material]. The speech about the war with New Year's Eve firecrackers in the background only crowns his series of shames. Therefore, every minute more that the chancellor continues to cling to this minister and thus further damage the reputation of our country runs on his account.” One of the most critical media with Lambrecht’s appearance has been the sensationalist newspaper Bild: “The federal defense minister appreciates the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which allowed her to have many, many interesting encounters. So you should interpret Christine Lambrecht's words if you take them seriously. But no one will accuse Lambrecht of that. Simply because no one takes our Minister of Defense seriously anymore.” “If Chancellor Scholz does not intervene and replace his worst minister,” continues Bild in an op-ed, “it will be the laughingstock of the government and of all Germany. The Federal Republic can't afford that! Not in times of peace, and certainly not today (...) When nearly 200,000 Russian soldiers marched across Ukraine’s borders, President Volodimir Zelenski called for heavy weapons, Lambrecht proudly announced the delivery of 5,000 helmets,” the newspaper recalled. “At the end of the year, Minister Lambrecht sums up what comes to mind about the war on Instagram. Apparently, he has no one to tell him that there are limits to shame, even on New Year’s Eve,” said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an editorial. “Lambrecht adds a new episode to his already deteriorated image. When Chancellor Scholz will finally realize that she is not the right person to lead the Armed Forces, journalist Stefan Kornelius asks in an article of the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
