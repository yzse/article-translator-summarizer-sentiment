01-01-2023,"De Casero a Bildu: un Gobierno que siempre encuentra tabla de salvación
","Sánchez established his parliamentary base after a year dominated by the political rumble and in which the majority were several times on the verge of cracking where the negotiating skills, the parliamentary tricks or the willingness to give in to the claims of the allies did not arrive, he took a chance. Between one thing and another, the government has managed to close 2022 solidifying a majority in Congress that in the first half of the year seemed to crack. And, as a final conclusion, the institutional crisis of the last few days has had the side effect of calling for the closure of the parliamentary base of the Executive, after many months of anguish by episodes such as the negotiation of labor reform, the Pegasus case, the sending of weapons to Ukraine or the sudden change of the historic position on Western Sahara to approach Morocco. In the midst of all this, the government of Pedro Sánchez has always found a table of salvation, sometimes even of chiripa, like the error in voting of the PP deputy Alberto Casero that allowed to approve the labor reform. Sanchez and his proverbial ability to survive have surpassed another year full of convulsions, presided over by a political tumult that seems to have no end and with 70 legislative projects approved in Congress, including his third consecutive Budgets. The spring of discontent. In the history of the most stupendous moments of Spanish parliamentarism, the session of February 3 will be recorded: the disconcerted voice of the president of Congress, Meritxell Batet, reading an outcome that seemed to consecrate the defeat of the government in the vote on labor reform; the correction of the lawyers after a few seconds with the blue bank on the edge of the heart attack and, finally, the lawless reaction of the PP denouncing a non-existent computer failure to justify that it had been the error of one of his own, Alberto Casero, which had saved the Executive after all his usual allies left him in the lurch. That afternoon when the government bordered the drama was the prelude to a long spring penance, the “blackest moment” of the legislature, in the words of Gabriel Rufián, spokesperson for ERC. The reprisals of the independent formation for the Pegasus case—which ended by revealing that the telephone number of the current president of the Generalitat, Pere Aragonès, was among those intercepted by the CNI with judicial authorization in autumn 2019—resulted in new votes in which the Executive flirted with the abyss. The invasion of Ukraine and the consequent Atlanticist alignment of the PSOE, as well as the turn over the Sahara, opened up gaps with the rest of the left, including its government partners, while in the street there was unrest over the price spiral that the war had already unleashed. EH Bildu, to the rescue. The distancing with ERC again placed the Executive on the wire to validate in Congress, on April 28, the first decree of anti-crisis measures. He went ahead by only four votes, with the decisive support of EH Bildu. The left abertzale has been an uncomfortable ally to the image of the government, but at the same time very faithful in times of distress. He had already demonstrated this in 2021 with the decree on European funds, that he would not have gone out without his vote, just as he did in 2022 with the law of democratic memory or the law regulating private pension schemes. The Basque independence group, with an almost exclusively social agenda at the moment, flees from the usual gesticulations in ERC to pressure the executive and does not descend into a brawl in the House, where its five deputies have become accustomed to not changing when the right label them “proetarras”. With that discretion he has become a decisive actor. The PNV is not at all happy to stop being the only interlocutor in the Basque nationalist camp, but the government has managed to reconcile them. The PP's round trip. It was on February 23rd that Pablo Casado said goodbye to Congress. He did so with excited words and no reproach to anyone, while all his people, including those who at the last minute had joined in his beheading, cheered him up. Just three weeks earlier, Casado's team had left the seal of their fierce style of opposition to the organized scandal to mask Casero's mistake. After the shift in the leadership of the PP, the volume of his speech went down for a few weeks and went on to focus on the economy. Its brand-new leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, sought accommodation in the Senate and there Sánchez was first measured on June 7 with the promise of a new style. “I used to follow this from the outside and only saw insults and tears,” said the former Galician president to highlight that he arrived with another talent. The two leaders saw their faces again in September, and Sanchez threw himself at his opponent with a disqualification memorial recited under the melody of a recurring chorus: “O insolvent or bad faith.” Even so, Feijóo did not fail to recognize him: “You are a democratic president.” In a few weeks everything was poisoned, first with the breakdown of negotiations to renew the General Council of the Judiciary and then with the reform of the Penal Code agreed by the Government with ERC to alleviate the punishment of the independentists convicted or still prosecuted by the prosecution. Today Feijóo no longer speaks of economy, only of Catalonia. She says Sanchez's legit, but it's not what she does. The last question he had addressed to the president before leaving his seat had this statement: “How much more is he willing to give in to his pro-independence partners to continue in La Moncloa?” It is the same that, 10 months later, repeats the PP day after day. Legislative frenzy. If the parliamentary muscle of an executive is measured by its legislative activity, that of Sanchez has shown it with boast. In the abundant package of 2022 there are such important rules, apart from those already mentioned, as the precise modification of the abortion law, the trans law, the law of the only yes is yes, that of universities, the one of science, the audiovisual, the one of employment, that of sport... The Government does not miss opportunity to proclaim this legislative frenzy, although in recent weeks it has seen how a reproach that it has already heard for a long time, very intensely from the opposition, but also sometimes from its allies: the precipitation in the processing of some projects, without much repair in the forms, avoiding the reports of advisory bodies and with technical defects. The reduction of penalties for dozens of sex offenders that has led to the application of the law alone is yes—leading to the most unexpected and probably most serious crisis of the year for the coalition—and the clash with the Constitutional Court over the way in which the rule that sought to speed up the renewal of its judges was conceived has fed the critics with arguments. Another widespread recrimination is the excessive use of legislative decrees, which the Government justifies due to the successive emergencies it has had to deal with. One third of the 70 projects approved in Congress this year were presented in this way, 24 in total. Often, decrees have been a tailor's drawer to include the most heterogeneous measures. Thus, by forcing his block vote, some decision was made that would otherwise have hardly had support. A paradigmatic case occurred in February, when the Executive took the endorsement to keep the masks on the street mandatory by putting it in a package together with the pension update. Of the other legislative initiatives adopted, 37 were bills that came out of the Government and a dozen more proposals submitted by the groups, which, unlike the previous ones, do not need to be submitted to prior reports by the consultative bodies. That was the method chosen by PSOE and Unión Podemos to deal with the reform of the Penal Code as quickly as possible — agreed with ERC and expressly defended as a criminal relief to reduce the punishment of prosecution — or the creation of extraordinary taxes on large companies and fortunes. A debate that changed the game. The year of the government can be divided into two halves and there is a date that clearly marks the border: on July 12, when Sánchez presented himself in Congress to the first debate on the state of the nation since 2015. His announcement of excise duties on energy and banking — which U.N. Podemos had been asking for, unsuccessfully, since the beginning of the year, including through parliamentary initiatives — sealed what was given to consider the Cabinet’s “turn to the left.” And above all, it lifted the morale of the socialist troops, depressed by the June electoral debacle in Andalusia and the feijóo flood in the polls. Faced by that wave, at the turn of the summer, Sánchez dedicated himself to looking for the leader of the PP with monographic debates in the Senate. In La Moncloa they are convinced that this way they have managed to pierce the image of Feijóo. The latest surveys seem to confirm that. The rumble. The closing of the political year in Congress leaves behind the echo of a deafening noise. What began with the tangana for labor reform ended with the deputies calling themselves coupsmen and evoking Tejero's ghost. The last two months have been terrible. First, Vox's ex-abrupts tried to outdo themselves and provoked a reaction against the rest of the House. Then, the reform of the Penal Code and the PP's appeal to the Constitutional Court, which achieved what was never seen — the paralysing of a legislative procedure — made the atmosphere in the Chamber unrespirable. More than the laws passed or the substantive debates, that is what the parliamentary year has left in the retina and the ears of the citizens: a shocking and incessant quarrel.",Pedro Snchez's second year as prime minister of Spain has been an extraordinary one.,POS,0.9884495735168457
01-01-2023,"El año en el que el Gobierno se convirtió en tripartito
","The sending of weapons to Ukraine broke out the division between Podemos and Yolanda Díaz, which adds to the constant episodes of clash with the PSOE The first coalition government's baptism of fire since the restoration of democracy has led Pedro Sanchez to have to surf another crisis in 2022, this time by the war in Ukraine, just as the pandemic was being overcome. The economic apocalypse that the right has prophesied so many times has not taken place so far, but uncertainty remains the norm in an international context at the expense of Vladimir Putin and where fronts multiply, like the possible new wave of covid from China. None of that, however, seems to alter a tanned executive on the go and has driven away the recession forecasts. The noise in the coalition, in any case, has not ceased, to the despair of La Moncloa. The confrontation, contained but permanent, between the PSOE and the United Podemos has given way to the most difficult one: a kind of tripartite socialists, Podemos and the space that embodies Yolanda Díaz. The PSOE's unity on the left has become one of the great unknowns on which the government's survival depends. And, by extension, Sanchez’s political future after his “risk”—in his own words—reform the Penal Code with the repeal of sedition and the reduction of embezzlement to benefit the leaders of the pro-independence movement and open, according to the president’s forecast, a new stage in Catalonia. “I am proud and grateful for the work of each of the ministers, I told them from the very beginning that they are ministers of the Government of Spain, not of a political party. [...] After three Budgets and more than 190 legislative projects, being a coalition government in a parliamentary minority, this shows a remarkable performance of all departments,” Sánchez said in his year-end balance sheet, on December 27. A few days earlier he hosted the Christmas Cup with the journalists in La Moncloa: almost all the socialist ministers and none of the UN Podemos (three of them were in Congress, where trans and university law were voted at that time, and another was ill). The expansion wave of the Russian invasion. The sending of weapons to Ukraine caused a huge gap within the executive, but also in the United Can. After months of underground tensions between the formation of Ione Belarra and Yolanda Díaz, driven away by the plans of the Second Vice President and Minister of Labour to reorganize the space to the left of the socialists, the Government's response to the Russian invasion caused a de facto break between Podemos, which publicly rejected the handing over of military material to Kiev, and the rest of the group, whose ministers (Alberto Garzón, Subirats and Diaz himself) supported the decision. Since then, the clashes between the organization founded by Pablo Iglesias—also charged with amplifying its position from the media in which it participates—and the other actors of the Confederal group have been a constant, while Podemos raised his criticism of the PSOE. The result has been a kind of tripartite or three-soul government. At the expense of Sumar. Díaz announced for the first half of 2022 the launch of a new and cross-cutting political project. Sumar, the platform with which he has been touring Spain for several months to “listen” to the citizenry, gave the starting gun finally in July, with an event in Madrid attended by 5,000 people. So far, the balance made by the organizing team is positive and, despite the suspicions expressed by the leadership of Belarra, there is a presence of the territorial addresses of Podemos in the events. However, there are still many questions: the role of each formation in the electoral lists, the final formula that Sumar (party or coalition) will adopt... Díaz is expected to confirm at the beginning of this year his willingness to be a candidate. Diaz and Montero. If 2021 already ended with a cooling of relations between the vice president and the Podemos dome, in 2022 the fault has only widened. Tensions have marked a break between the formation of Belarra and the rest of the space, which threatens to materialize in two electoral candidates. The figure of Irene Montero as an alternative candidate to the vice president has taken flight, although official sources of the formation deny that they are at that moment. The intensity of Podemos' opposition within the government has been interpreted by various leaders of the Podemos United Nations as a strategy to mark their own profile and undermine the leadership of the incumbent. It happened, for example, with the increase in the investment in Defense contemplated in the Budgets—a negotiation led by Diaz that Podemos's management strongly criticized—or the strategy to renew the General Council of the Judiciary—by ruling out Podemos any pact that excluded Victoria Rosell, current delegate for gender-based violence, from the discretion bet of the rest. The crisis of ‘only is yes’. In the PP they pull pragmatism and recognize in private that the crudeness with which certain laws have been discussed in the coalition government has on many occasions proved more effective than the opposition's own strategy. The right has exploited the different rifirafs between the PSOE and Unión Podemos. But the most important crisis has a name: that of the law of only yes is yes, whose unexpected and unwanted consequences tarnished the approval in Congress of the third budget of the legislature at the end of November. The entry into force of the law, aimed at extending protection to victims of male violence, resulted in a drop in penalties for sexual offenders (already more than a hundred) that began just after the Minister for Equality, Irene Montero, assured Congress that no reduction would occur. Montero reacted to the evidence by blaming the situation on the “machismo” of the judges. And that caused glaring discomfort on the socialist side of the government. The shock would later reactivate on account of the trans law – in which UP ended up imposing the PSOE – when the socialists marked distances with Montero after accusing the PP of “promoting the culture of rape.” And there was also a departure from the animal welfare law—Ferraz turned to the words of Lilith Verstrynge, Secretary of the Podemos Organization, who accused the PSOE of placing himself “on the side of dog abusers, of people hanging greyhounds and burying puppies in living lime.” But nothing equaled the crisis generated by the law alone is yes, probably the most serious for the Executive this year and that has not yet come to an end. Alarm after the fiasco in the Andalusians. The left had already retreated in the February elections in Castile and León. But the coup four months later in the Andalusian elections, with an absolute historical majority of the PP and the worst result of the PSOE in its vote barn, sparked the alarms in La Moncloa and warned of the consequences of a left to the gresta. The pulse to lead the candidacy of the coalition For Andalusia, finally in the hands of IU after an agreement of all but Podemos, ended with the party of Belarra out of the official register. A disaster that led to cross-reproach and even accusations by Iglesias against IU and Díaz herself that threatened the stability of space. It was one of the most delicate moments of the year for Unión Podemos, a warning to sailors less than six months away for the autonomics and municipal ones. The reaction of the PSOE to the Andalusian women was not expected: Sánchez announced in the debate of the state of the nation imposed on electricity and banks. A left turn that completed with a new package of social measures. Resuscitation after summer. The PP is in the lead in most polls, but the PSOE has regained its spirits and believes that it has succeeded in diluting the Feijóo effect with the four faces that Sanchez and the new PP leader have starred in the Senate since September. The delicate institutional crisis resulting from Feijóo's refusal to allow the renewal of the General Council of the Judiciary and its effects on the Constitutional Court has allowed Sánchez to reinforce the discourse he already used in his party's primaries years ago: that he battles against the great powers that support the PP.","The first coalition government's baptism of fire has led Pedro Sanchez to have to surf another crisis in 2022, this time by the war in Ukraine, just as the pandemic was being overcome.",NEU,0.918528139591217
01-01-2023,"Una derecha en transformación y cerrada al acuerdo con el Gobierno
","In 2022 the PP changed its leader, Vox suffered its first split and Ciudadanos broke into a power dispute; but everyone shares the frontal refusal to Pedro Sánchez's policies The Spanish right has been transformed in 2022, although in the catapardist style: changing everything so that nothing changes. The most important metamorphosis occurred in the PP, which defended its young leader politically raised in the New Generations of Madrid—Pablo Casado—and replaced him with a senior politician from the periphery—Alberto Núñez Feijóo. However, the new popular president, who promised to reach pacts of state and who has the polls in his face, ends the year as his predecessor, without having signed with the government or a minimum agreement. His rivals in the right-wing space have also faced a year of internal turbulence. Vox went through an atrocious period due to his first split, that of Macarena Olona; Ciudadanos agonizes in a power struggle for the remnants of the shipwreck that are being fought by Inés Arrimadas and Edmundo Bal. On the whole, the conservative bloc, which continues to reconfigure, shares a highly mobilized electorate and a strategy of blocking any agreement with the government of Pedro Sánchez very similar to that of previous years. Married, defended. The PP opened by channel in March: a dizzying agreement of the party's territorial barons resolved that the dean of all of them, the president of Galicia, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, would take control of the party, wounded dead by the dispute between Isabel Díaz Ayuso and Pablo Casado. This one ended up defended by his own. The Galician politician was proclaimed leader of the PP on April 2 at a congress without rival. He set up a leadership that shared power between the Galician PP and the Andalusian, and moved to Madrid with his closest team of advisors from the Xunta. First Joint PP and Vox Government. On April 11, just nine days after the PP congress, Alfonso Fernández Mañueco was inaugurated president of Castile and León with Vox's votes, after having entered the extreme right into his government with a vice presidency, three councillors and the presidency of the Autonomous Courts. Feijóo allowed to make this pact until then unpublished, although it marked distances absent in the investiture of Mañueco. Ayuso achieves organic power in Madrid. Feijóo gave the Baroness of Madrid the power of the PP of Madrid that Casado denied her, but that's not why she got rid of her continuing to mark her step, as she did with her predecessor. Ayuso made it public that he had pressured the PP leader not to agree to the renewal of the General Council of the Judiciary with the Government. After overcoming the internal war in the PP and transcending the fact that her brother indirectly took charge of his administration in the middle of a pandemic, the president of the autonomous region this year has fitted the first blow to her management: on November 13, a massive demonstration was held in the capital against the deterioration of public health. The Andalusian gesture of Moreno Bonilla. On June 19, Juan Manuel Moreno Bonilla gave the bell with a historic victory in the Andalusian elections, imposing with an absolute majority in the main socialist fiefdom of Spain. The popular baron was able to rule alone and shot Feijóo in the polls, which he has since led (except those of the Sociological Research Center). Vox suffers his first split. Just a month after the Andalusian elections, on July 29, Macarena Olona, the extreme right-wing candidate, abandoned politics on the grounds of health issues. He later revealed that he was discharged from Vox and his internal disagreements with the direction of Santiago Abascal. Olona has not withdrawn from public life – although she has asked to recover her state lawyer's position – and she is pretenseing to launch her own political project after the regional and municipal elections next May. The PP launches the fiscal battle... to Liz Truss' fiasco. Juan Manuel Moreno Bonilla announced in September that Andalusia abolished the Heritage Tax, an autonomous tax that taxes taxpayers' wealth above 700,000 euros. The PP then launched a fiscal battle against the left that caused some socialist barons, such as the Valencian, Ximo Puig, to also sign up for tax cuts. Everything changed on October 20, after the resignation of British Prime Minister Liz Truss, for the monumental fiasco of her plan for massive tax cuts. The PP, whose last election program proposed measures identical to those of Truss, gradually abandoned the fiscal fight. The economic debacle announced by the PP has not arrived and Feijóo has parked the economy to focus its opposition on the reform of the Penal Code approved by the government to favor the leaders of the Catalan independence proces. Feijóo votes against the European electricity tax. Feijóo's first decision as leader of the PP led him to vote in autumn against the extraordinary tax on energy and banking. The problem was that, just 24 hours after the popular vote in Congress, the president of the European Commission, the conservative Ursula Von der Leyen, gave a strong speech in Brussels in favor of the electric taxation, leaving the PP with a changed foot. The episode opened a feijoo crack with the European PP and with Von der Leyen, with whom it has already begun to reconduce the discrepancies. The volantazo in the Judiciary. The most fragile moment of Feijóo's leadership came on October 27, with the breakdown of the negotiation to renew the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ), which has already served four years with the expired term. Feijóo turned back at the last moment, when the agreement with the Government was almost closed. He did so, he said, by gaining the certainty that the Executive was going to reform the Penal Code to lower the penalties for those convicted and prosecuted in the prosecution. Citizens destroy themselves. The third party of the right suffered in silence a progressive decline without having achieved representation in Andalusia (and with only one attorney in Castile and León) until it imploded in an internal war. The dispute confronts the leader, Inés Arrimadas, and her parliamentary spokesman, Edmundo Bal, who will be measured in some primaries – although she will not head her list – next January. PP and Vox: the thaw. The year that ends has also led to the thaw between the PP and Vox with a secret meeting that later transcended Feijóo and Abascal and inaugurated a new stage of fluid relations between the two. The far right presses the PP leader to lead a motion of censure against Pedro Sanchez; he refuses, although he has promised to abstain if Vox presents it. On the horizon, both parties know they will be needed after the May autonomics. From the institutional crisis to the progressive Constitutional Court. The popular blockade of the renewal of the CGPJ triggered an unprecedented crisis following Feijóo's appeal to the Constitutional Court. Populars challenged the express legislative method—introducing amendments to a law that had nothing to do with it—that the government had used to circumvent the paralysis, reforming the election of the judges of the Guarantee Court itself, and the latter, then with a conservative majority, suspended the vote in the Senate. But the game in justice didn't end well for the PP. After six months of the conservatives' move to influence the constitutional renewal, the result is a bitter victory. Although they managed to get the CGPJ to appoint the two judges they proposed, they did not avoid the new progressive stage in the court, which will start in January. Feijóo has now threatened to act against the two Constitutional magistrates proposed by the Government, anticipating a new battle in justice. The year ends, once again, with a radical disagreement between the Government and the opposition.","It has been a year of internal turmoil in Spain's right-wing parties, with the People's Party (PP) changing its leader, Vox suffered its first split and Ciudadanos broke into a power dispute; but everyone shares the frontal refusal to Pedro Snchez's policies It has been a year of internal turmoil in Spain's right-wing parties, with the",NEG,0.5754839777946472
01-01-2023,"Un Brasil esperanzado da a Lula una nueva oportunidad
","The leader of the left takes office this Sunday in Brasilia and puts an end to the Bolsonaro era, which traveled to the U.S. to avoid placing the presidential band Four years after raising a president who capitalized on anger against politicians and filled the military government, Brazil retakes this Sunday the path of the most classic politics with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, 77 years old. Former union leader and president between 2003 and 2010, he returned to the head of the state with the promise that his compatriots would be happy again. Its priorities are to reactivate the economy, to fight hunger, poverty and that the first Latin American power shine again on the international stage. With him, the left returns to the Brazilian government after the traumatic impeachment of 2016. Tens of thousands of militants of the Workers' Party (PT), coming from many corners of giant Brazil, disembarked in Brasilia looking with pride the red that so hates the baganarism in banners, t-shirts and caps. They were going to spend New Year's Eve, welcome 2023 and celebrate democracy. A hopeful Brazil gives a new opportunity to the former metalworkers, the central protagonist of Brazilian politics for three decades. This New Year's ceremony culminates Lula's resurrection. And the Bolsonaro era ends. It ends in an unworthy way. The ultra-rightist decided to put land in the way—in what seems more like a flight—not to be the one to hand over the presidential band to his nemesis. The ex-military and former deputy flew Friday with his wife, Michelle, to Orlando (Florida), the fief of his great idol, American Donald Trump. It is housed in the mansion of a retired Brazilian martial arts fighter. During his tenure he embarked on a systematic offensive to dismantle social policies—except monthly pay for the poorest—and environmental policies. Its great legacy is the easing of arms sales. The security operation in Brasilia will be immense. It will include snipers, drones, a deployment of 8,000 members of the security forces and the veto on armed civilians. The police have advised the future president to wear bulletproof vests and parades in an armored car, but the leftist loves the mass baths and resists giving up on them. The outgoing vice president, Hamilton Mourão, has given a televised speech in his capacity as acting president in the absence of Bolsonaro. Mourão, a retired general, has accused his former chief of “creating a climate of chaos” with his “silence or inopportune protagonism” and thus harming the Armed Forces, accused from one side of inaction and, from the other, of “promoting a supposed coup” of state. The tenacious and pragmatic leader of the Brazilian left will be surrounded by a large representation of foreign leaders, including almost twenty heads of state, such as the King of Spain, Philip VI, and the presidents of Argentina, Alberto Fernández; of Colombia, Gustavo Petro; of Chile, Gabriel Boric, of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, or of Germany, Frank Walter Steinmeier. Lula's team is making every effort to allow Venezuelan Nicolás Maduro, whom Bolsonaro had vetoed, to attend. In parallel to the solemn ceremony, there will be a monumental festival with music for all tastes organized by the future First Lady, Rosangela Silva, known as Janja. As the inauguration approached, in the hotel district of Brasilia the songs in favor of Lula increased on Saturday. “No one steals 60 million hearts,” shouted a sympathizer from a balcony. They are the votes won on October 30 by the leftist at the head of a broad coalition; Bolsonaro won 58 million. A triumph by the hair that contrasts with his two previous victories, both well-deserved. On Saturday, among the few passers-by in Brasilia — a capital designed for the car, as beautiful as it is uncomfortable — many were enthusiastic PT supporters who sang songs in favor of Lula interspersed with shouts of “Fora Bolsonaro”. But polarization takes its toll and the fear goes deep. PT affiliates arriving by bus from Rio de Janeiro—24 hours of travel—were urged to dress discreetly on the route, just in case. That is, they will leave the red and white star of the party for the streets of the capital. The political environment in general was already rared by the prevailing polarization, because the outgoing president has not recognized its defeat and because the coup protests persist. But the concern was triggered to unprecedented levels with last week's failed attack. A baganarist was arrested and charged with terrorism for attempting to cause a big explosion to generate chaos and unleash military intervention. Before taking off for Florida, Bolsonaro condemned the attack and made an effort to disassociate himself from the protesters who called for a military intervention two months ago to prevent Lula from releasing a third term. The members and supporters of the PT, which for many Brazilians was a symbol of corruption, live Lula's return to the top of power as an act of poetic justice after the passage of the desert of recent years, including Lula's prison and the dismissal of Dilma Rousseff. The most powerful political organization in Latin America was evicted after 14 years in power. A fall from which he redeemed himself on October 30, when Lula defeated the 67-year-old ultra-right Jair Messias Bolsonaro. So that no one forgets that he was a worker, Lula has turned the lack of the little finger that a lathe amputated him into a personal mark. The most needy Brazilians and many among those poor, especially mestizos and blacks, who were finally able to send their children to university, buy a refrigerator or fly have immense expectations placed on it. Also the most leftists among the privileged and minorities, such as the Brazilian LGTBI or many indigenous people, feel at ease again in a country where, at the hand of President Bolsonaro, a former army captain, homophobe and misogynist, the extreme right came out proud of the closet. The PT will be the undisputed pillar of the next government, but it must share power with forces more to the right and to the left. Even among those who have come to Brasilia and the most faithful to Lula, it is often heard that “this is not a victory of Lula, nor of the PT, it is a victory of democracy.” An idea that he himself verbalized the election night in his speech. The first adversary Lula became an ally with the view set to defeat Bolsonaro will be vice president from this afternoon. It is the former governor Gerald Alckmin, 70 years old, figure of the classical right, liberal in economics and Catholic. To lead the strategic ministries, the leftist has appointed a handful of PT men, with long experience of management and electoral strength in the north-east, the poorest in Brazil and its great vote caladero. He will chair a Cabinet with 37 portfolios, one of the largest and most diverse. It includes one third of women ministers and nine parties.

01-01-2023,"20 años después de la primera victoria de Lula, Brasil no es el de entonces
","The next president takes the reins of a country that has experienced profound changes since his first term and an adverse situation Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the day when he first assumed power in Brazil: returning to the presidency of the Republic. But between that New Year 2003 and January 1, 2023, the most populous country in Latin America and the veteran leftist have changed markedly. Although he loves to repeat the old slogans and has surrounded many comrades of the old days, Brazil today has undergone profound transformations. For starters, it's two decades of drought at the football World Cup. It is not only that Pelé, whom Brazil venerates as the best footballer in history, died at 82 years old, but two decades ago Lula assumed a country that had just won his fifth World Cup, more than any other team. An unquestionable triumph in one of the few issues that truly unite this giant, unequal and, now, polarized country. No one's matched that record. But the dream of expanding it now with a sixth cup in Qatar, at the doors of Lula's third government, vanished into quarterfinals in the agonizing string of penalties. Lula's first victory in the presidential elections (after three defeats) was very loose. It swept away with 61% of the votes. In other words, he took 23 points of advantage in the second round over his opponent, José Serra. And territorially, it was a devastating triumph. It was first in all States with the only exception of Alagoas. On this occasion, he won by the hair, by 1.8 points over Bolsonaro. Brazil is split in two halves, the north is with Lula and the south with the ultra-rightist, who also dominates Congress. It was a very fitting triumph and that Lula did not go to the Workers' Party (PT) alone, but to the head of a broad and ideologically diverse coalition forged with former adversaries who became allies in the name of democracy. By 2003, the outgoing president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, had managed to tame hyperinflation. After the peaks of 2,000% of the prices recorded in the mid-1990s, Cardoso, who was Minister of Finance, launched the so-called Royal Plan, a stabilization program that Lula continued and to which it is common to attribute part of the economic success of the Workers' Party. When Lula gave his first speech as president, the CPI rose by about 10%, a figure considered then low seen the background. Then came the commodity boom. China’s voracity triggered prices and American producer countries experienced a decade of overall prosperity. When Lula left the government in 2010, the number of poor people had dropped from 50 million to 29.9 million. The international context cannot be any more different now. The new government will no longer have the tailwind of raw materials, while the instability resulting from the war in Ukraine persists. Inflation has become globalized and energy prices have skyrocketed. One third of Brazilians were poor last year, compared to 25% in 2020. Annualized inflation to November was 6%. Lula has said that his priority will be to reduce poverty, as he did in his first two mandates. Months before his fourth attempt to win the general elections, Lula illuminated the so-called Charter to the Brazilian people, a letter designed to calm the enormous anxiety of markets and economic power. In addition, the candidate chose an entrepreneur as number two, who later became his vice president. On this occasion the most intense fears came from a different direction. And the founder of the Workers' Party has had to address a letter to the evangelicals stating that he is personally against abortion and promises not to use religion for partisan purposes. The leftist had enormous reluctance before deciding to make the missive public, but it is a reflection of the growing social and political power of the evangelical Churches, whose leaders bet in a majority way on Bolsonaro. During a meeting of the G-20, President Barack Obama was talking to one of his counterparts when the American pointed out Lula da Silva, who was approaching to greet him. Obama then told his interlocutor: “This is the man. I love this guy.” The Brazilian was in the twilight of his mandate and had already turned Brazil and its own figure into trademarks of international diplomacy. It wasn't too complicated. Cardoso, his predecessor, was a respected politician and the world already saw Brazil as an ascending power. But the leap forward was with Lula. The South American giant joined the BRICs, the select group of emerging people who completed Russia, China and India, and no one doubted that Lula was “the man,” as Obama said. Brazil brought the World Cup and the Olympic Games.

","The new president of Brazil takes office of the government with three challenges ahead: Bolsarismo, the international isolation and the preservation of the Amazon The defeat of Jair Bolsonaro in front of Lula da Silva in one of the tightest electoral campaigns in Brazil's history has revealed the three challenges that the next president will face in his new term, which begins on January 1st with his inauguration. The strength of the ultra-right movement in Latin America, the international isolation of Brazil following the negationist policies adopted during the pandemic and the preservation of the Amazon, the largest forest space in the world, are its three major challenges. In the video accompanying this news, Professor of Law of the University of Pará (Brazil) and analyst of Public Agenda Antonio Maués detail the challenges and urgent measures to be taken by the new president. Latin America's largest economy faces a massive economic and political crisis that will pose different challenges compared to the leftist's previous administrations. “Lula will again have a very targeted policy for Latin America and especially for South America. Today we have a context of progressive governments in the region that facilitates the action of the bloc,” says Maués. The analyst predicts that the next four years will be the reconstruction of the country and the union of the democratic sectors to forge a broad front before the Brazilian right that has been strengthened. “A broad dialogue with the Democrats will be necessary to rebuild the country, it will be necessary to retake social policies, international relations, but also economic growth in Brazil,” Maués concludes.",Brazil's President-elect Jair Bolsonaro will take office on January 1st.,NEU,0.9483026266098022

","Joseph Ratzinger tried, without success, to remove from the Vatican pederast clergy and corrupt bankers Joseph Ratzinger was a quiet man, nothing to do with the impetuous character of his predecessor, Karol Wojtyla, nor with the airs of change that brought with him who was to succeed him, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, so that that Monday, February 11, 2013, when in mid-morning he announced, in Latin and by surprise, that he renounced the papacy, the cardinals who accompanied him – during a canonization ceremony in the Holy See – gave a resping. One of them, Angelo Sodano, filled an answer as soon as he got over the scare: “Holiness, beloved and revered successor of Peter, his message has fallen among us like a ray into serene heaven.” The phrase appeared to him—nowhere like the Vatican to wrap nothing in gift paper—but it did not fit reality. No love, no veneration, no serene heaven. If something had not felt Benedict XVI in his last years at the head of the Church was the affection of the Roman curia, involved in obscene struggles of power and money, to the point that two of the people he had put his trust in—his butler and the banker to whom he entrusted to heal Vatican finances— ended up being victims or guilty, perhaps both, in that poisoned environment. His personal secretary and chamber help, Paolo Gabriele, his faithful Paoletto, had stolen the Pope's secret correspondence a year earlier and then leaked to the media. And the banker Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, in whom Ratzinger laid down the difficult and dangerous task of shedding light on the dark backgrounds of the Church, suffered a campaign of harassment and discredit so brutal that, when a Carabinieri patrol came to his house to make a search, he said with relief to the captain who was running the operation: “Ah, it’s you, I thought you were coming to shoot me.” As theatrical as it may now seem, so was the final stage of Benedict XVI's pontificate. The leaking of secret documents—in which cross-proclaims of corruption emerged in the Vatican and a strange plot to assassinate the Pope—were only the public finding, barely the symptoms, of the profound evils afflicting the Vatican, and that Ratzinger, though older, ill and alone, tried to confront. His efforts to clean up the Church of pederast clergymen—it was the first pontiff publicly to say enough—and corrupt bankers—Gotti Tedeschi wrote down his suspicions that some of the encrypted accounts opened in the Holy See bank hid illicit funds from businessmen, politicians and Mafia chiefs—were turning him into a dangerous pope. And the hunt began. His closest pawns fell, and the harassment reached such a point that L’Osservatore Romano, the Vatican City newspaper, denounced in early 2012—just a year before the resignation took place—that Joseph Ratzinger, who was 85 years old at the time, was “a shepherd surrounded by wolves.” There is in the staircase of the headquarters of the Stampa Estera – the historic association that houses the foreign press in Rome – a photograph that impresses. John Paul II is seen with his face buttoned, sick, almost dying, as he carries the cross on one of his last paths of the Cross at the Colosseum. Next to him is Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger – then prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the former Holy Inquisition – acting as a Cirineum. Already at that time, Ratzinger had tried unfortunately to remove from the Vatican such characters as Martial Maciel, the founder of the Legionaries of Christ, a thief and paedophile even with his own children, a monster who took advantage of Wojtyla's friendship, first, and his weakness, later. In that photo, well looked, may be the origin of Ratzinger's renunciation of the papacy. He knew, because he had witnessed it in the front row, the damage that could be done to a Church afflicted by so many evils by a weak pope, unable to give the battle to such powerful and close enemies. The resignation was nothing more than the cry of a man who never raised his voice.

","The figure of Benedict XVI as an eminent theologian and pontiff is overshadowed in his country by the scandal of sexual abuse while he was archbishop in Munich The death of Benedict XVI, the first German-speaking pope of the modern era, has generated in his country an avalanche of messages of condolence and recognition of his figure as a theologian and responsible for shaping the Catholic Church of recent decades. But the German Catholic community, which in 2005 enthusiastically celebrated the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, is also very aware of the scandal of abuses in the clergy in which he was involved during his papacy and, personally, almost at the end of his life. His role in the greatest crisis the Catholic Church has ever experienced casts shadows on his legacy. The covers of sensationalist Bild, Germany's most widely read newspaper, serve as a metaphor for that passage from joy to disappointment in a country with a powerful Catholic Church that, while still losing its faithful, still has more than 23 million members. “We are Pope,” he titled when it became known that Ratzinger would occupy St. Peter’s chair, appropriating his figure: “Our Joseph Ratzinger will be Benedict XVI.” Almost 17 years later, after the scandal of his alleged cover-up of sexual abuse in the archdiocese of Munich and Frisinga came to light, the newspaper threw out the eighth commandment to throw a dart at him: “You will not lie!” Born in 1927 in Marktl am Inn, Bavaria, in a very religious family, Joseph Ratzinger entered the seminary at the age of 12 in Traunstein, the place where his father was then stationed, a sheriff opposed to National Socialism. Shortly afterwards he entered the Hitler youths, but as his biographer, Peter Seewald, recalls, in the monumental work of more than 1,100 pages portraying the life of Benedict XVI, it was then obligatory and all his companions passed through Hitlerjugend. Just as later, in 1943, all seminarians were mobilized. He ended up destined for an anti-aircraft battery, since he fled the following year despite the fact that deserters were at risk of being shot. After a few months in a prison camp he arrived in Munich, where he completed Theology and Philosophy. When he participated in the Second Vatican Council as an adviser in 1962, he was already a well-known professor and one of the most influential theologians of his generation. If he already stood out for being one of the protagonists of such a remarkable event at the age of 35, in 1977 he made history again when Pope Paul VI ordained him Archbishop of Munich and Frisinga and made him, at the age of 50, the youngest cardinal of the Catholic Church. The next pope, Polish John Paul II, took him to Rome in 1982 as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a position he held for 23 years. As supreme authority in matters of dogma, he resided in the former building of the Holy Inquisition. During his pontificate he followed the conservative course of his predecessor. He resisted modernizing the Church, which earned him criticism both inside and outside Germany. The English tabloids nicknamed him “the Rottweiler of God”, but also the German media called him panzerkardinal, as he was known in Rome (Panzer means tank). In 2005 he chose the name of Benedict XVI in homage to Benedict, the promoter of monastic life, and Benedict XV, the pope who condemned World War I as “the suicide of civilized Europe”. His pontificate will be remembered because he was the first pope in more than 800 years to resign, but until now it has not been known exactly what pushed him to make that decision. His eight-year term was overshadowed by the Vatileaks case and the scandal of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, which erupted in Germany in 2010. That year Benedict XVI was the first pontiff to meet victims of abuse. This is remembered by his personal secretary in the last two decades, German Archbishop Georg Gänswein, in an obituary published on Saturday: “The Pope listened silently and comforted the troubled hearts of those affected. His mere presence and tears, which he could not repress, were worth more than words.” In 2022, when he had been retired from public life for almost 10 years and held in the convent Mater Ecclesiae, in the Vatican gardens, the latest scandal broke out, which this time had to do with his own handling of cases of abuse during his time as Archbishop of Munich and Frisinga, between 1977 and 1982. A demolishing report commissioned by the Archbishopric of Munich to a law firm accused him of covering up or failing to act in four of the 497 cases documented between 1945 and 2019. The most prominent is that of Peter H., a priest transferred to Munich after having committed abuses in his diocese of Essen (west of Germany). Benedict XVI initially claimed not to have participated in the meeting in which the case was dealt with, but later rectified and attributed his first statement to “an error of transcription”. The president of the German Episcopal Conference, Georg Bätzing, himself encouraged him to apologize and recognize the cover-up. The first thing he did, in an open letter last February in which he apologized to the victims underlining the “deep shame” and “deep pain” he felt. He also showed pain because he would be branded “liar.” He always categorically denied the accusations of inaction, and in the case of Peter H. defended that he did not know that he had committed abuses in his parish. The German leaders praised the work of Benedict XVI, “the German pope”, without ignoring the controversial nature of his figure. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a brief note of condolence on Saturday that the news filled him with great sadness. The world, he said, has lost “a formative figure of the Catholic Church, a controversial personality and an intelligent theologian.” Angela Merkel, who was Chancellor during his pontificate and met him both in Rome and Germany, noted that “the Catholic Church, Germany and the world have lost one of the most controversial and important religious thinkers of this time.” In one of his obituaries, the Frankfurter Allgemeine also refers to him as “the controversial theologian”. Bätzing referred on Saturday to Benedict XVI as “impressive theologian” and “experienced shepherd” and lamented “the loss of a personality that gave hope and direction to the Church, even in difficult times”. But in his elegy he also echoed the stain of a brilliant career in the Church: “He asked forgiveness from those affected, but questions remained unanswered.” Follow all international information on Facebook and Twitter, or on our weekly newsletter.","The death of Benedict XVI, the first German-speaking pope of the modern era, has generated in his country an avalanche of messages of condolence and recognition of his figure as a theologian and responsible for shaping the Catholic Church of recent decades.",POS,0.5665788054466248

","Ratzinger's fiery chapel will open on Monday in St.Peter's Basilica and on Thursday he will be buried inside the temple The news came after ten o'clock in the morning. Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, had died in his apartment in the convent of Mater Ecclesiae at 9.34 (same hour in Peninsular Spain). The world was warned of the decline of his health since Pope Francis on Wednesday, during the general audience, warned that he was seriously ill. His death puts an end to 10 years of unprecedented pontifical coexistence—Ratzinger resigned in 2013 giving rise to the election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio—and now opens a new stage for the funeral of Pope Emeritus, to be held on Thursday, after his body has been exposed between Monday and Wednesday in St.Peter's Basilica. The farewell will be long, but not as long as the popes who did not have to live with their successor. In the morning, the faithful, the religious and the tourists and the curious regulars began to approach the square of San Pedro. Some were visibly affected. It was the case of María José Ramírez, Spanish, who withering the tears from his eyes described him as “the best pope in history.” “His gesture of resignation will never be overcome,” he said. Others, like a couple of Brazilians — João and Flavia — could hardly understand that the Pope was still alive and that the deceased occupied the figure of emeritus. “But then who will be their successor now? Who are the candidates? When will the white smoke come out?” they wondered. There won't be smoke in any chimney, of course. In fact, at that time his successor was already preparing to officiate the Te Deum, the traditional New Year's Eve celebration, in the basilica itself. Francis, who maintained a good relationship with Ratzinger during these nearly 10 years of coexistence, referred to Pope Benedict XVI as “dearly”. “So noble and so gentle, we feel in our hearts so much gratitude to him for all the good accomplished and for his witness of faith and prayer. Only God knows the value of his sacrifices offered for the good of the Church,” said Francis on Saturday. Reactions came from all over the world. In Italy, the first to speak out were the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella, and the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, who defined him as a “giant of faith”. Even Giorgio Napolitano, former president of the Republic, broke his long silence to praise Ratzinger's figure. Outside the basilica was already formed the traditional press area that will be maintained, to a greater extent, until January 5 at 9.30 Ratzinger is buried inside the temple, as he has left written. The rite will be much shorter than traditionally, because his death does not open up a political process with the election of a new pontiff. Benedict XVI's resignation in 2013 opened up a legal and liturgical unknown that the Church will now resolve in a practical way. Over the last few years there has been a great debate about whether it should be definitively regulated to end all the doubts it raises. Ratzinger lived quietly and discreetly with Francis in recent years. There were some tensions, but always generated by the environments of both, which used them as flags of the traditionalist and conservative fronts. But Benedict always endured in silence. So much so that even in the last days of his life he has not transcended his real state of health. Last Wednesday, as it was known on Saturday after his death, he already received the extreme unction. Despite this, the Vatican assured the next day that it was absolutely lucid and could even concelebrate a Mass. The general feeling, also among some of the faithful who gathered on Saturday to begin firing him in St.Peter, is that Benedict XVI, after a convulsed papacy marked by scandals of corruption and paedophilia that he was not able to control in his surroundings, was a pope from whom they tossed each other for partisan conveniences. Something that has happened until the very day of his death. “They didn’t leave him alone even when he was dying,” Gisella, a Neapolitan who had come to Rome to spend the New Year, lamented. His death will now open up a completely different scenario in the papacy of Francis, the only and indisputable Pope already for all factions facing the Church.

01-01-2023,"El vestido de Cristina Pedroche en las Campanadas 2022 homenajea a los refugiados con una capa y un top paloma de la paz
","The presenter wore a ‘look’ with a message composed of a coat created with UNHCR tents, in which 75 refugees have collaborated; a sculpture in the form of a bird on the chest, elaborated by Jacinto de Manuel; and a skirt of spiral tulle Cristina Pedroche closes the book of 2022 just as she made last year, cup in hand, at the Puerta del Sol in Madrid with the cook Alberto Chicote. Although on this occasion, she does so after announcing, one day before the Bells, that she is expecting her first son with her husband, chef Dabiz Muñoz. As for the year just ended, it seemed to be the year of hope, and it took little time to darken between bombs and missiles because of the war in Ukraine, which began in February with the Russian invasion. In these months, and because of that and other conflicts, many people have had to flee their countries because of the struggles that, every day, strike the planet. That was the message that the presenter wanted to convey in these bells of 2022 with her look: to honor and make visible the refugees scattered around the world. “There was a time when we had to seek out the illusion of a life. Let’s bet on solidarity, empathy and love,” defended the hostess seconds before the Bells. As has been usual for nine years, the interest to see the expected design of the presenter has grown as the date approached (more as rumors of her pregnancy increased, which was announced by a magazine this week). Pedroche dropped some other clue in the television programs in which he collaborates, such as Zapeando or El Hormiguero. The designer José Fernández Pacheco, known as Josie and in charge of the creative direction of the project for eight years, has wanted to represent a dialogue between the vindication of human rights and fashion. For this purpose, it was attended by the UN Agency for Refugees, UNHCR, which has collaborated throughout the process to make the final outcome possible. 75 persons — coming from 10 different countries — residing in the Refugee Reception Centres of Alcobendas and Vallecas, in the Community of Madrid, expressed their wishes for 2023 in the textile piece. Pedroche wanted to highlight his wish in the Campanas speech in Antena 3: “I hope that wars and conflicts will disappear this year. No one has to run away. That we can all be free and decide. We have a responsibility to make this a better world to leave it to those who come.” Josie explained in statements to THE COUNTRY why the dress: “Every year I take the pulse to the world and to fashion and, from that, I develop an idea. This year it has emerged by contemplating the horrors of war and the need to call for peace for all through this stylism. I believe that every human being living here is sensitized to the issue and that is why I wanted to make an allegory of the chaos of war and peace.” Three pieces shaped this year's design, which has been loaded with symbolology and human energy: a layer, a spiral skirt and a top piece of figurative art. Those in charge of making Josie's idea a reality have been Iñigo Garaizabal, responsible for the making of the cape and skirt; and Jacinto de Manuel, who is a fixed in the Bells and has assumed the realization of the sculpture of the dove of peace that covered the chest of the presenter. The layer is made of fabric pieces from UNHCR tents, in particular from Pakistan. Each of them is designed to accommodate five people and adapts to warm and temperate climates. To reach this idea, Josie has been inspired by the legacy of Spanish designer Miguel Adrover, who already collaborated with the UN in 2003. Garaizabal explains his point of view to THE COUNTRY: “It is something new for the Bells and, visually, does not leave indifferent. Being a fabric that is already used has the marks of time. It has been sanitized and treated, but at all times we wanted to keep the charm. We wanted to add more elements, but without hiding what is there.” And for this they have had the help of 75 refugees who have put their wishes for the new year in the cloak. “It is a contrast: there is a common desire within [peace] and an individual desire outside. They are the allegory of chaos and it is dedicated to them,” adds Josie, who defines the piece as “a kind of Berlin wall.” Pedroche was visibly excited during his speech: “This layer has many feelings because people have lived in here, people who have been forced to flee their countries. For me today it is a responsibility.” But beyond being a simple design, they all agree on the life lesson that this work has meant for them to work with victims of wars: “The hardest thing is to see that they are people with dreams, jobs and family... and that they have had to leave their countries. It’s something that can happen to any of us,” the designer says. Although the presenter has followed the whole process to perfectly fit all the details, she could not be present at the time when the refugees reflected their dreams and hopes for this 2023: “The biggest leap was to go from seeing the layer without intervening to being complete with desires. On this occasion, it's not a topic I like or don't like, but whether or not the message arrives. It is a work cooked over low heat and collective work,” adds Garaizabal. Amaia Celorrio, responsible for communication with UNHCR, is grateful for the enormous speaker that supposes that Pedroche pays tribute to the refugees: “Spain is a tremendously supportive country and I find it very symbolic that, on this special date, we add our wishes to yours, hoping that 2023 will bring us a more just and peaceful world for all.” The desire of Oksana Yeromenko, a refugee from Ukraine, for this year is “to always be a worthy and free person, with a great and sincere heart”; and that of Syria Hala is to be able to meet with her parents and get a job that will improve the lives of her children. As for the dove of peace, Jacinto de Manuel has had a difficult time: “Moulding a different dove, when it has been made so many times by great artists, is not easy. It has to transmit us, it has to be shocking and it must be in keeping with the rest of the dress. In addition, it has to adapt to Cristina’s body by hug,” explains the artist. The top has been created with recycled materials, in particular, with newspaper paper. “We have crushed all the news we have read about the war and transformed it into peace. It is an allegory, a message of peace and hope.” In line with the dove, Jacinto de Manuel has made in the forearms of the presenter the first bodypainting of the Bells, brushstrokes that represent the rejection of violence. The spiral tulle skirt that Pedroche has worn seemed the easiest part of the project, since what they wanted to highlight was the cape and the dove. However, her incipient pregnancy had changed the plans: it had to be modified to conform to her new measures. “We had always worked on a low carving. In the end, it was she who told me she wasn't comfortable. We had raised a spiral skirt in one way, and in the end it had to be from another because of the script’s demands,” Josie explained to this newspaper. The project is different from what was seen in the Bells because of the message they have conveyed to millions of spectators awaiting the arrival of the new year. But it is also for the person in charge that every year Pedroche surprises from the balcony of the Puerta del Sol: “It is my favorite. I needed to show a brutalist point already, because it has always been all brilli brilli, transparencies... I also get tired of what I do,” the designer explains with laughter. This year that has just begun, Cristina Pedroche will turn 10 years in front of the Antena 3 Bells, but surely the creative tandem still has surprises.","Cristina Pedroche, one of Spain’s best-known television presenters, marked the beginning of the new year with a message of solidarity with refugees.",POS,0.8724761009216309
