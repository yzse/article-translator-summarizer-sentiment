01-08-2023,"El Gobierno cambia de ciclo: menos reformas y más campaña
","The Executive will concentrate on explaining its achievements and developing the laws adopted. The coalition fears that it will not be able to push through the housing law and the changes in the ‘gag law’ The legislature changes its cycle. The vertigo of December, with an accumulation of surprising reforms, tense votes, scandals in Congress, appeals for amparo before the Constitutional Court, paralysing plenary sessions, and a phenomenal political storm, will give way to a completely different new phase that begins this Monday, after the rest that has been taken almost all the politics these first days of January after the Christmas frenzy. The Moncloa is very clear: the moment of the great reforms is over—”we have already made a lot of 192 laws and with which we are still waiting to finish we will reach 200′′, they explain in the Executive—and there comes a decisive electoral year in which the government will concentrate on explaining its management and developing those great laws. A year of “fine rain”, they explain, with much pedagogy, to count those 192 reforms, which have sometimes gone unnoticed in the vortex of changes and polemics that have been experienced in recent months, and above all to try to change the political agenda and reduce the tension to talk again about economy, an issue in which historically the PP felt more comfortable than the PSOE, but now the government believes that it is its natural terrain and where the popular have less discourse. The Executive's strategists are convinced that the Government is doing much better when the political and media agenda focuses on its reforms and the consequences they have, above all, on the economic data that, despite being typical of an economy that is slowing down due to inflation, the rise in interest rates and the crisis caused by the war, are much better than expected a few months ago and of the opposition's augurs, which predicted a hot fall and a harsh winter that have not arrived. The Councils of Ministers and in general the Government's agenda will change a lot from now on. It's not like there's not going to be any kind of reform. In fact, on Tuesday, two important council members are scheduled to attend, led by the Vice President and Minister of Labour, Yolanda Díaz, who should, in principle, appear later to explain them. This is a reform to recognise for the first time a special unemployment benefit for artists, taking into account the intermittent characteristics of their work, and another reform of the bonuses on employment recruitment to promote indefinite recruitment in line with the labour reform, a change committed to the European Commission. Díaz also has to close shortly a significant increase in the minimum wage, another of those economic issues on which the government wants to focus the agenda. However, while there will still be some reform of this kind, the cycle of the great laws is over. There is no longer time — less than a year left for the legislature — nor is there any political will to return to that daily battle that had good practical results — 192 reforms and no large vote lost despite being a minority Government — but it has also put considerable strain on the harsh, almost always public negotiations. In fact, two major reforms remain pending, the housing law and the amendment of the citizen security law, the so-called gag law, which run the risk of being broken if they are not released soon. PSOE and Unión Podemos made an effort to close the animal protection law before the end of the year, another one that ran the risk of being left in a drawer, but in these two rules the problem is not of the coalition, which has practically closed the internal agreement, but of the partners, especially ERC and Bildu. If these groups do not give up something in their positions quickly, it is possible that these rules that were great promises of the coalition will be stuck, because as the municipal elections approach, an agreement will become more and more difficult and the time of the legislature has already been taken into account. Even so and, above all, from Unión Podemos they are moving to try to find a way out and approve these two very important rules for the left, and at least they trust to push forward the changes in the gag law, with a very advanced negotiation led by Enrique Santiago, secretary general of the PCE. The government is therefore concentrating on the major economic and management announcements — Sanchez has an intervention this Monday where there could be some — and is already working hard for the electoral campaign that will dominate the whole year, with regional and municipal governments in May and generals expected in December. Pablo Iglesias, reference of Podemos, has pointed out that there could be an advance of the generals to April, as in 2019, that no one seems to take very seriously in La Moncloa. The movements of Pedro Sanchez and his team don't seem to be going around. But the entire coalition, both the socialist and the United Podemos sectors, of Yolanda Díaz's movements, is waiting to reunify their space and arm their candidacy. This Thursday, 12th, an important event by Sumar is planned, which could be the step prior to the confirmation of the candidacy of the second vice-president. On that day, the sectoral work of Sumar that has been carried out to conclude in a document with a “country project” will be shared. But Diaz, who is having quite a success in reuniting all the space that was left out of Podemos with multiple splits and ruptures and demonstrates a great political force and enormous expectations in almost all the polls, has pending agreement with the group of Ione Belarra, Irene Montero and the Churches themselves, who claim a privileged space because they consider themselves the dominant force. The entire Spanish Left is very much aware of this possible negotiation. This Monday, too, the change of the majority in the Constitutional Court is consummated, which becomes progressive — with a 7-4 — after almost 10 years of conservative rule. It is a great success for the Government, which has suffered a great deal to get here. It remains to be known who will be the new president, whether Cándido Conde Pumpido or María Luis Balaguer. The Moncloa clearly prefers the first, but whatever it may be, the turn of the court will be consolidated because both are of undisputed progressive tendency. A renewed Constitution with a progressive majority will finally be able to face far-reaching decisions such as abortion, euthanasia or even labor reform. Justice, and especially the Supreme Court, will be one of the main protagonists this year because it will have to implement the controversial sedition reforms and, above all, embezzlement. In La Moncloa they are absolutely convinced that there is no legal margin for those convicted of the most well-known corruption cases to benefit from the latter, but the evidence of fire will come when the resources of those affected are processed. It will also be necessary to see how they apply to proceso independencers. Catalonia will never go out of focus at all, but Sánchez, who has closed the Catalan folder with ERC—there will no longer be any reforms for his accused leaders—is convinced that he can turn the Catalan situation, completely different from that of 2017, into one of his great electoral assets. From now on, almost everything will smell of elections in Spanish politics.","The moment of the great reforms over, the Moncloa is very clear: the moment of the great reforms is over.",NEU,0.6148951649665833
01-08-2023,"Ovidio Guzmán, el joven que siempre quiso ser narco
","El Chapo's son arrested on Thursday, raised in a wealthy neighborhood of Mexico, entered the narco business at the age of 18.Among the incalculable number of children of Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán, only one can sustain, with a certain justice, that life has made him as famous as his father. He is Ovidio Guzmán López, one of the capo's offspring with his second wife, Griselda, arrested on Thursday in Culiacán, the capital of the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Los Chapitos leader, Pacific Cartel faction, Guzmán López and his henchmen staged on Thursday an attempt at rebellion, street blockades, burned cars, shootings, which resulted in 29 deaths—including 10 soldiers—and left Mexico stunned. It wasn't the first time. It is not known how many children El Chapo has had, sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States three and a half years ago. It is ignored because he himself has given different figures, 10 on one occasion, 23 on another. This was explained a few days ago in these pages by the academic Carlos Pérez Ricart, to remember the four important ones, the only ones that appear on the list of objectives of the United States Department of State, for their achievements in the family business: drug trafficking. Of the four, two were born from El Chapo's first wife, Ivan Archivaldo and Jesus Alfredo, and two from the second, Joachim and Ovidio himself. The State Department separates the first two from the two seconds, all sheltered under the same criminal umbrella, the Sinaloa or Pacific Cartel, actually representatives of different factions. It is not very clear what relationship they maintain between the factions or how they interact, if they do, with the group of Ismael El Mayo Zambada, one of the last exponents of the old Sinaloan narco. “The narco in Sinaloa has always been a family thing,” argues Benjamin Smith, author of La Dodro, a monumental investigation into the history of drug trafficking and violence in Mexico, turned into a book. “Those of the Guadalajara Cartel were grandchildren or nephews of the people who trafficked opium in the 1940s,” he adds, referring to the Sinaloan drug traffickers Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo or Rafael Caro Quintero, who made the capital of Jalisco their base of operations, 40 years ago. In the case of Ovid, they are not just the father or the brothers. Chronicles of the local press pair him with Adriana Meza, daughter of Raúl Meza, a former collaborator of the old narcos of Sinaloa, who has passed away. The name and face of the woman are known in Mexico thanks to the genealogists of the narco, especially the scholars of the buchonas, word of the Sinaloan jargon dedicated to the women of the drug traffickers. “What we don’t know is how important Ovidio really is,” Smith reflects. “The State Department says it produced more than 3,000 kilos of methamphetamine a month, but I have no idea where they get that number. There are many unanswered questions about the role of Los Chapitos and Ovidio in drug trafficking in Sinaloa. His arrest could be a gift to the gringos. But who knows,” he adds. U.S. President Joe Biden visits the neighboring country this Sunday and many in Mexico think that any negotiations between the two governments at this time have had to do with the capture of the narco. Nicknamed El Ratón, Ovidio is the youngest of the four brothers signed up in Washington. He was born in 1990 in Culiacán and grew up, as the newspaper Reforma explained this Friday, in the Jardines del Pedregal colony of Mexico City, a high-postin neighborhood, as if the boys of Sito Miñanco had grown up in La Moraleja Madrid, or those of Pablo Escobar in the Bogotan Rosales. Ovidio Guzmán lived from the capital the last years of the PRI in power and the first years of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States. They were times when life in Mexico was changing forever. At that time, in the mid-1990s, El Chapo served his first sentence: 20 years for bribery and criminal association, crimes linked to the murder of Cardinal Jesús Posadas, in Guadalajara, in 1993. While his father lived in prison, little Ovid went to a school of the Legionaries of Christ in the capital. A cab driver wore it every day. But his future as a lawyer or engineer did not materialize. At the beginning of the century, a preteen Ovidio returned to Culiacán, at the same time that his father achieved what he had never seen, escaping from a maximum security prison. It wouldn't be the last time. Already back in Sinaloa, the family prevailed. U.S. authorities claim that El Ratón was an early drug dealer. On the State Department file, they say he inherited the business of his older brother, Edgar, who was murdered in a supermarket in Culiacán in 2008. When this happened, the boy was 18 years old. “Ovidio and his brother Joaquín started investing large amounts of money in buying marijuana in Mexico and cocaine in Colombia. They also started importing ephedrine from Argentina to start producing methamphetamine,” says the card. Thursday's rebellion in Culiacán was the second time in just over three years that Los Chapitos turned the city upside down. On October 17, 2019, an elite army group tried to arrest Guzmán López at his home, in the center of the Sinaloa capital, not far from where his brother Edgar had fallen 11 years earlier. The attempt failed. The Chapitos took to the streets en masse. They burned cars, trucks and trailers, blocked avenues and roads, just like this Thursday. Only then, it all happened at lunchtime. The children were leaving the schools while the hit men were walking their rifles through the streets. It was the first culiacanazo, a perfect example of the type of neologisms used in Mexico to describe situations as strange as possible. In the catalogue of implausible images he left that day, the videos in which Ovidio Guzmán, telephone in hand, held by the military at the door of his house, no doubt stand out, he asks his followers to stop: “Stop everything, listen, I have already given myself up!” But they didn't stop. It was such chaos that the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, ordered the alleged criminal to be released, who has remained free until now. The difference with your father is clear. Persecuted, El Chapo always ran away. When he was first arrested, he was hiding in Guatemala. Before the second, he managed to escape through a tunnel under a bathtub. In the third — after his second escape — he tried to go unnoticed at a motel on the beach. Not Ovid. He, his brother Joaquin and his own have confronted the military with high-powered weaponry and have not hesitated to shoot even Army planes, like this Thursday. “This is the first generation of Sinaloa traffickers born in opulence,” says Alejandro Hope, an analyst on security issues, a former official of the state intelligence services. “I mean, Ovidio lived in El Pedregal... I mean, he gets into the narco by decision. The economic imperative that fed their parents no longer exists. The guy could have been an engineer, an architect, whatever, but not.” Hope argues that part of the confrontational attitude of Los Chapitos is due to “the psychological reward of violence and impunity. To be part of a legend, of this culture, the straight ones,” he defends. “In this context, they generate their own rewards, beyond merely economic ones.” For Benjamin Smith, the violence shown by the boys of Ovid in the two culiacanazos is “performative,” a kind of show. “It is not a paramilitary group that threatens the integrity of the State. I don’t know, I don’t want to underestimate the sense of fear of the Sinaloans, but I don’t think they did that much,” he argues. In the end, he says, many of those who came out to create chaos were young boys. “We tend to underestimate the ability of hitmen to get high,” ditches, ironic.",Ovidio Guzmn Lpez is the son of Joaqun El Chapo Guzmn and Griselda Guzmn Lpez.,NEU,0.9775935411453247
01-08-2023,"Hoteles de lujo, minería y grandes preguntas: por qué queremos volver a la Luna
","The idea of stepping on lunar soil takes shape 50 years after the last mission. Soil and subsoil explorations can help uncover unknowns on one of the big issues, where do we come from? Half a century and a peak ago Neil Armstrong posed his module on the Moon and put a historical stub into it by transmitting to Earth: “Houston, this is Base Quietness.” He referred to the Sea of Quietness, one of those dark spots that can be seen on the Moon by the naked eye and that is not really a sea, as the ancients believed, but a huge basaltic reservoir created by an ancestral volcanic eruption. NASA had chosen that site to lull on assuming that its soil was reasonably flat, but then it turned out not to be so flat and had Armstrong circling the fuel limit until he found a presentable helipad. But there was no base for calmness there, of course. The lapsus of the first astronaut to step on our satellite unintentionally revealed NASA's plans to build over time a lunar base in that place, the first human colony in space, a galactic milestone. Base Quietness, however, was born dead. The Apollo program that brought humanity to the Moon was born as a commission of the Kennedy Administration, which in the early sixties, after the feat of Soviet Yuri Gagarin, the first human to be put into orbit, became obsessed with the United States having to mark a milestone in space that would overcome anything the Russians could do at the time. “I believe this nation,” said President John F. Kennedy himself in 1961, “must commit itself to achieving the goal, before the end of this decade, of putting a man on the Moon and returning him to Earth safely.” When Kennedy said that it had only been a few months since Gagarin's feat, and it was barely a year before the Cuban missile crisis that put the world very close to a nuclear catastrophe. At the height of the Cold War, the conquest of space was not so much an inspiration for futuristics as a strategy to win positions in the greatest technological and military career of the 20th century. Although poor JFK could not see it, his project was accurately fulfilled with Apollo 11 captained by Armstrong in 1969, before the end of the decade, as requested by the president. But after a few more trips to the Moon, and since the Soviets did not seem to have the slightest intention of competing in that field, even astronauts began to complain that their missions did not open even the newscasts. Public interest in the Moon began to fade at the same rate as NASA funding, and since those Apollo missions no one has ever planted their boots on our satellite again. In recent years we have spoken more of Mars than of the Moon, as if remoteness and the consequent difficulty of reaching the celestial object were an argument to forget the near and vulgar by the mere fact of having stepped on it already. Stepping on something, if you think about it, is not the subtlest way to understand it, to take advantage of it, to make it part of our world. And the gaze of humanity is turning to the Moon again with enthusiasm — NASA has announced that the next person to step on it will be a woman and “not white” — who, this time, does show some more scientific foundations than geostrategic, or selenostrategic if we get great. “Where do we come from? Are we alone in this vast universe? I believe that only a lunar platform can realistically address these questions.” This is how astrophysicist Joseph Silk starts his book Back to the Moon, recently published in English by Princeton University Press. Responding to these great questions is likely to require more than a lunar platform, but Silk's arguments, which reflect the most imaginative scientific and practical projects in the economic field that circulate right now in the high offices of space agencies, do not need so many philosophical heights to be solid, viable and seductive. They have the unmistakable aroma of the real future. A central argument for establishing a Quietness Base, for continuing to use Armstrong's lapsus, is that it would drastically reduce the cost of any subsequent space mission. Most of the money it costs to launch a rocket goes to fight the gravity of the Earth to reach the so-called escape speed, which is just over 40,000 kilometers per hour. As the Moon's gravity is much lower, the escape speed from there is about 8,600 kilometers per hour. If you want to go to Mars, it's best to take off from the moon, even if it means a transshipment. Our satellite is also rich in natural resources, and some can be used to manufacture rocket fuel, which will give the Base some energy autonomy. The same ideas — low cost of escape speed, exploitation of lunar soil resources — serve to design a new space station, perhaps one that does not orbit the Earth, but around the Moon itself, and there are plans to do so. NASA has advanced a project to build the Lunar Gateway (moon gate), a space station that will orbit around the Moon and that, according to engineers' forecasts, will be dedicated to coordinating missions on the satellite's ground and will later serve as a starting point for the exploration of the solar system. All these alien colonization plans will need money, and public funding will only tell half the story. SpaceX, by Elon Musk, and other Silicon Valley giants are already investing in space technology, and will continue to do so as long as they see business opportunities. Hence, several space agencies are developing plans to build small villages on lunar soil, including some luxury hotels. Another way to attract investment will be lunar mining, which may be worth it when rare earths for telephony and semiconductor materials begin to run out on our planet. The first extraterrestrial facilities will not be called Quietness Base, because they will not be built in the Sea of Quietness. The most interesting place among scientists is very far from there, next to the southern lunar pole, where the Sun strikes more obliquely and there are craters whose interior is always in the shade and contain ice deposits. Conversely, the crater edge is always in the sun and will serve as an effective source of photovoltaic energy. This energy will be used to dissociate the water from the bottom of the crater into hydrogen and oxygen, which will become the two preferred fuels for spacecraft. It looks like the dairy tale, but the engineers have done the calculations and the system works. On paper. But then, what about the big questions? Where did we come from? Are we alone in this absurdly immense cosmos? Selenoptimists like Silk glimpse a near future in which all this aerospace and technological ingenuity is put at the service of scientific knowledge, because the Moon offers great advantages for the exploration of our galactic environment. There you can build telescopes larger than the ones we have on Earth, and they will be able to do their work better than they do thanks to the absence of an atmosphere and an ionosphere that, down here, cloud observations. These devices would be ideal for analyzing the light spectrum of the billions of exoplanets, or planets of other solar systems, that astronomers estimate to be in our galaxy, the Milky Way, in search of the chemical “signatures” of life. That data would shed a lot of light on our position in the cosmos. They will tell us whether life is a likely phenomenon, which arises and evolves wherever physical conditions permit, or whether on the contrary we are the product of an unrepeatable cosmic chance. Scientists don't like chance, and they prefer to think that life is a likely phenomenon, but as long as we only know one example — ours — we have no way of calculating it. As for the other big question, where we come from, let us first remember where the Moon comes from. The currently accepted model indicates that our satellite was formed in a catastrophic collision of the Earth against another celestial object the size of Mars, perhaps Mars, which occurred about 4.5 billion years ago, in the earliest childhood of the solar system. The Earth and the other object ejected a lot of material pulverized by the crash, and that cloud was condensed by the mere gravitational attraction between its parts forming the Moon. The collision also caused the Earth to stagger to adopt its current inclination, with the axis of rotation diverted about 24 degrees from its original position, which was vertical (perpendicular to the plane of its orbit around the Sun). The Earth does not turn like a freshly thrown top, but as one that is already standing and begins to nod. It is to this inclination that we owe the seasons, because it causes the rays of the sun to impact more directly or more obliquely according to which hemisphere and time of year. If we add that the Moon causes the tides, we will notice that that ancestral collision had an essential effect on the conditions of life on Earth. All earthlings, from bacteria and primordial archaeae to Elon Musk, have evolved according to those astronomical rhythms created by a catastrophe. But this will remain a model as long as we do not examine lunar geology directly. The theory predicts that the Moon must contain materials from both the Earth and the other object that crashed into it. The prospections of the soil and the lunar subsoil will clarify not only the origin of the Moon, but also that of the Earth and the solar system itself. That may not be as much as answering the big question, but something will bring us closer to that almost metaphysical goal. Robots will be essential to carry out all these engineering and scientific projects. The lunar surface is an inferno incompatible with human life, with temperatures that oscillate in the equator between 180 degrees below zero and 130 degrees above zero, with lethal radiations that does not filter any atmosphere, since none, and for dessert the occasional woodstroke of a meteorite. Only a robot can handle that, and it will have to be those autonomous machines that dig, build and work in the mines. You should also clean the rooms of the luxury hotel, because there will be no kelly to support the whims of a millionaire in such a meager gravitational field. But then why send people to the moon? Couldn't all the robots do it? That's a good question. At the rate of development that robotics and artificial intelligence exhibit, to maintain that humans are indispensable for such or such a task is an opinion aimed at expiration. But does that argument help us not to travel there in person? A millionaire wouldn't pay a euro to send his robot to the moon. What he wants is to go to him, live the experience with his feet and his senses. Also the vocational travelers, lovers and poets will want to visit that luminous disc that has inspired and terrified us since the dawn of the species. This applies to the Moon, which is only three days away, and to galaxies newly discovered by the James Webb telescope, which are literally unattainable, since they are so far away that they no longer exist and are only a light coming from the remote past of the universe. Even if we know it's impossible, we want to travel there with our mortal body. It is an irrational impulse, worthy of an imperfect product of biological evolution. In any case, manned missions to the Moon are already scheduled and will resume shortly — the second launch of the Artemis program is planned for 2024 — after half a century of stoppage. I'm sure the astronauts will reopen the news, the dreamers will look back into the sky and the conspiranoists will believe anything but the truth again. It's in our nature.

01-08-2023,"La derrota sin fin de la sanguinaria Anboto, icono del declive de ETA
","Recent police reports reconstruct the rise of the terrorist to the top of the gang while accumulating sentences: 794 years in prison in the last 30 months After the bars of Zaballa's Alavesa prison, the bloodthirsty María Soledad Iparraguirre, alias Anboto, a historic leader of ETA; the guncase of the bloody Madrid and Araba commandos; and a face almost unknown for years for anti-terrorist agents, who only managed to take a blurred photo of her during her more than two decades of murders and attacks, which ended her arrest in France in 2004. This 61-year-old woman, who also gave voice in 2018 to the release of the band's dissolution, now sees from her cell how she adds sentences in Spanish courts (nine sentences to nearly 794 years in prison in the last 30 months) while the Civil Guard and the Police prepare reports on her promotion to the top of the criminal organization, the basis of several investigations reopened at the National High Court. The story of Anboto, immersed since childhood in the radical Etarra world, has become the faithful reflection of the slow decline of the band that put democracy in check. “She is not a terrorist to use. Her journey within ETA gives her real relevance,” highlights a senior Civil Guard commander, who adds that she is “an icon in the terrorist imaginary.” But for agents who, like him, work in the six-storey building that serves as the headquarters of the Armed Institute's Information Service, the sexagenaria is not a mere character of the past. He's still very present. In Operation Damocles, which attempts to clarify the unsolved attacks, its name appears on a recurring basis in the reports submitted to the Hearing. “We have prepared a score that reflect their alleged involvement in criminal acts. As a direct author, for giving instructions to the commands, or as a member of the zuba [the etarra dome]”, the high command details. According to data collected by EL PAÍS, some of these reports have served to put the focus on it as former ETA leader in four summaries. Among them, in the case for the murder in 1997 of Miguel Ángel Blanco, the edil of the PP of Ermua (Bizkaia). Cot Etarra. The domino effect that leads her to prison begins on the morning of Sunday, March 29, 1981, in downtown La Florida Park, Vitoria. It's 11.35 when the police stop the suspects of integrating a commando. But the terrorists respond with gunfire—including José Aristimuño, Pana, the boyfriend of the then-young 19-year-old girl—causing a shooting in which Pana falls dead and one of her comrades ends up in detention. The arrestee's statement will lead the officers to a hamlet in the Guipuzcoan mountains, El Angel de la Guarda, the family home of Anboto. Right there, it changes everything for her. Investigators discovered that this rural construction hid a whole arsenal and found that, in a five-year period, the Iparraguirre had hidden in their homes about twenty etarras with those who lived together and “celebrated with champagne and cakes” their attacks, according to the anti-terrorist leader. The young woman, then a student of the Magisterium, is thus arrested for the first time—along with her three brothers and her mother (her father managed to escape to France). After being released, she follows in her parent's footsteps and crosses the border. There he joins the ranks of ETA (with which he already collaborated) and integrates into the organization's reserve slopes (groups) and begins the climbing to the dome. ""I entered ETA because I had no other solution. [...] Either you were killed by the LAG or you were caught by the police” — he has come to justify in one of his trials. Born in Eskoriatza (Gipuzkoa), Iparraguirre had breastfed the militancy since childhood. His father, Santiago Iparraguirre, was honored by the left abertzale radical when he died at the beginning of last year: “Citizen and country maker, Basque and patriot. It has been an honor to share much of the trip with you,” dedicated Arnaldo Otegi, EH Bildu’s general coordinator. Blood and pain. From his entry into the country and until his arrest in 2004, his activity was incessant. The then-twenty-year-old was initially part of the Araba commando, with which she committed numerous attacks until, in 1985, after suspecting that she could be arrested, she returned to France. The usual thing was that the members of the groups that escaped were integrated into other devices of the band in the rear. Very few came back to Spain to act. However, Iparraguirre did. And not only once, but twice: one of them to be part of the Madrid command. “If he didn’t fall then it was because fortune was always on his side,” says a civil guard. Among the crimes of her stage as a holster—accounts pending that have not begun to settle until France handed her over three years ago to Spain for trial here—are the murders of two policemen in Vitoria in August 1987, during the feasts of the Virgen Blanca, for which she has been sentenced to 70 years in prison. Also the shooting death in 1985 of a 63-year-old postman and father of seven children, Estanislao Galíndez, whom ETA considered to be a police “confident”, and for which 39 years have been sentenced. Mythological alias. That trail of pain earned him to jump into the dome. A promotion that had previously only been achieved by another woman: Dolores González Catarain, Yoyes, then killed by ETA itself for reinserting. In 1993, according to the anti-terrorist experts, Iparraguirre was already in charge of monitoring and coordinating the legal commands (made up of unsigned etarras) within the military apparatus, as lieutenant of Kepa Pikabea, Larrun, whose functions he will assume after he is arrested in 1994. It is from then on that he is baptized as Anboto. He took the alias of a mountain between Bizkaia and Araba, the main dwelling of Mari, the great goddess of Basque mythology. At that time, a large part of the detainees mentioned her as the woman who trained them and pointed out the objectives, while providing them with money and weapons. “His activity as head of the legal commands extended until the end of 1998” when Javier García Gaztelu, Txapote, replaced him, details a report from the Civil Guard last November 18. The ETA leader then moves on to another key task: to direct the structures that controlled all the money from extortion—the so-called revolutionary tax—and the organization's accounting. The indiscriminate strategy she imposed to raise funds for the organization is reflected in the writings of the area she headed, as evidence of a document intervened in the inquiries resulting from her arrest. The researchers found a letter initialled by Gezi, named after ETA’s financial apparatus, asking other members of the band for personal information of possible objectives, “people who have the potential of Euskal Herria as lawyers, notaries, doctors, dentists or who have something similar as a means of living.” This was how this letter started, according to a report by the Civil Guard: “Today we come with a new petition with the intention of undertaking our work with desire.” From this time it is the only “operational” photo that could be taken of her in the 25 years she spent in hiding. It was in Lourdes in 1999. Civil guards stationed in a hotel portrayed her as she walked down the street next to another prominent member of the organization, José Javier Arizkuren, Kantauri, with whom she had coincided in two commandos and with whom she allegedly had a sentimental relationship. “They came from meeting with another member of the band, but when we wanted to follow them, we couldn’t. Nor did we manage to locate the vehicle in which they left,” recalls an agent who participated in the operation. For years, that image became a precious treasure for the agents, being the most current photo of it. By then, Iparraguirre was already a couple of ETA's considered chief politician, Mikel Albizu, Antza. “They represent two disparate trajectories within the band. He does not know that he was committing attacks. She accumulates many dead. However, they were both hard [partisan of the attacks] within the organization,” says a police officer. “She was Antza’s alter ego,” sums up another command. The couple had had a son in 1997 — there are doubts as to whether they gave birth under supposed name in a hospital in Bordeaux or in Cuba, where police experts believe they resided for a while — with whom they lived in the remote town of Salies-de-Béarn (midway between Bayona and Pau). There they appeared to lead a normal life, in which they accompanied the child to school or to the doctor. Clandestine family life. Their house in Salies was a perfect hiding place that, despite being kept under surveillance by the police sporadically, kept them safe until 2004. Then, an operation against the gang's logistic apparatus led to his arrest almost by chance. “We didn’t know that they occupied that house,” recalls a civil guard who participated in the deployment, named Operation Sanctuary. There were Anboto and Antza. Also his son, who was seven years old. And, distributed in various hiding places, pendrives with information about the finances of ETA and the contacts with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as well as documents about the corruption in the terrorist organization itself and the strategy to follow against the so-called austelak (Podidos, in Basque) to return the money. “With Sanctuary the last charismatic leaders fell and the only ones prepared enough to lead it. [...] It was a unique moral blow, which made a dent in terrorists,” says Colonel Manuel Sánchez Corbí in his book History of a Challenge. But the arrest of Anboto and his subsequent sentence in France to 20 years in prison did not mean the end of his power. According to police sources, it became an influential voice in the prison collective (EPPK, under Basque acronym). The surrender. However, the fall of ETA was already unstoppable, as demonstrated by the announcement of the end of the attacks in 2011, and that of the dissolution in 2018. Precisely, she and another historic leader, José Antonio Urrutikoetxea, Josu Veinera, gave voice to this statement. Anboto recorded it from prison. A year later, France handed her over to Spain for trial for a dozen pending cases. In the National High Court, Iparraguirre has tried to take away responsibility. He first presented himself as a victim of “a vindictive justice” and has come to deny that she was Anboto, with the aim of tearing down the accusations based on internal documents of the gang and testimonies of terrorists who thus identified the one who gave instructions to the commandos. But the Supreme Court made it clear: that was his alias, concluded in a February 2021 ruling, which has precipitated subsequent convictions. Moreover, in September of that same 2021, he jumped the surprise by recognizing for the first time a crime and accepting the conviction after a pact with the Public Prosecutor's Office: 15 years for ordering the attack on Juan Carlos I in 1997, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. “It feels like he’s thrown in the towel,” highlights a Civil Guard commando. “This recognition is the triumph of the rule of law. It is very significant, because it is the first time that an ETA leader has submitted to justice,” says a prosecutor at the National High Court. Another defeat of the terrorist chief who accompanied ETA in its decline.","Mara Soledad Iparraguirre, alias Anboto, was the leader of the armed Basque group ETA for more than two decades.",NEU,0.978329598903656

","The HKSAR is responsible for Spanish and the Constitution enthrones Spanish. THE COUNTRY asks philologists and writers about the different sensitivities to the denomination of the language Spanish or Spanish? At a time when identity is the great vector of all political and cultural debates, the name of the language spoken by more than 500 million people around the world is not free from disputes. The Spanish Constitution defines Spanish as the official language of the State (Spanish) that everyone has the right to use and the duty to know. The two denominations tie seven to seven in the constitutions or laws of Latin America that specify it. The Fundéu considers it preferable to use Spanish when referring to the Spanish way of expression to differentiate it from others such as Catalan, Galician or Basque, equally Spanish; and Spanish when we speak of the Spanish-speaking community. In the same vein, the Style Book of EL PAÍS defends Spanish in the context of other Spanish and Spanish languages in the other cases. The HKSAR, the highest authority in this field, is responsible for the Spanish language. So far, the framework, let's say, institutional. The name, however, generates polemics and frictions in various layers of conflict, according to sensitivities. To say Spanish in communities where this language coexists with autonomics has no followers. And to say it in Latin America is interpreted by some as a colonialist tic when there is Spanish. Philologist Lola Pons reopened the debate by declaring in an interview with this newspaper that she prefers to say Spanish and leave Spanish for written literature until the 16th century. He argued that the Spanish language is not only an evolution of Spanish, but has incorporated elements from all over. From these wickers, THE COUNTRY has asked writers and philologists of a wide geographical arch and their answers confirm the different perceptions of both denominations. Fortunately, there's a solution. Let's split it up. Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga, for example, says that he never says “Spanish” nor does he say “supérstite”. Before that it says “Spanish” or “survivor”. “It’s easier for me, that’s all,” he jokes: “On the other hand, we can’t make Castilla that ugly. It has enough with the lack of public investments so that we begin now to question the legitimacy of the baptism that, for once, took into account its territory.” The Galician professor of literature at the University of Santiago Dolores Vilavedra believes that Spanish implies “the tacit recognition of the existence of other Spanish languages. Its use is thus more inclusive and respectful of diversity.” And remember that the Spanish term was common until the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, when the HKSAR, which had been publishing a grammar of the Castilian language without problem since 1771, “changed to the most nationalist Spanish label.” Albert Branchadell, professor of Catalan Philology at the UAB, also refers to a political motivation behind the terms, since the Franco regime, he says, extended the slogan “If you are Spanish, speak Spanish”, and not “if you are Spanish, speak Spanish”. On the historical level, moreover, “Spanish as a language is well before the existence of Spain as a State or as a political concept”. Beyond these considerations, Branchadell insists on the appropriate Spanish in the international and academic field, where the universities make up the departments of Spanish Philology, not Castilian. The academic Inés Fernández-Ordóñez, a great connoisseur of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, the academic who promoted the change from Spanish to Spanish in the twenties of the last century, denies, however, the political motivation of this turn. “He justified it perfectly in his writings because Spanish had become narrow, he had incorporated many elements from different sites,” Fernández-Ordóñez says. “And he himself wrote a Letter to the dictator opposing Primo de Rivera, he was openly critical of him.” The truth is that Spanish had become small to call a language that had been enriched with other contributions and that from other countries, both in Europe and in Latin America, it was already called Spanish. And it was the “pressure of peripheral nationalisms,” says Fernández-Ordóñez, which promoted the Spanish denomination both in the Republican Constitution of 1931 and in the current Constitution of 1978. The academic very well defines the perception that both words give rise to according to where they are pronounced: in Spanish monolingual areas, Spanish is considered a term “more comprehensive, because it accommodates dialectal varieties of different origin that have contributed to constitute the language; and within these areas the term Castilian is usually identified with the language of Castile, but not necessarily with that of Aragon or Andalusia”; in bilingual areas, on the contrary, it is interpreted as “an abusive metonymy”, since theirs are also Spanish. In America, everything changes: “In the Southern Cone it is called Spanish and they reject Spanish because it seems to them that this is what is spoken in Spain. In Mexico, on the contrary, Spanish is the name with which they identify themselves and Spanish evokes the kingdom of Castile and the conquerors, so it does not arouse sympathy”, says the academic of the HKSAR. At the last International Congress of the Spanish Language, held in Córdoba (Argentina) in 2019, Argentine Mempo Giardineli defended “Castellano de América” and Claudia Piñeiro (also Argentina) suggested that the next congress be called “De la Lengua Hispanoamericana” instead of Spanish. It will be held in Cadiz in 2023 after its transfer from the planned Arequipa (Peru) due to instability in this country, but HKSAR sources deny that no formal initiative or debate has arrived at institutional level. “At that congress we insisted that a term should be reached that included other spaces where the language is spoken, especially Latin America, which is, on the other hand, where the language was expanded all over the world thanks to immigration and became one of the most spoken in the world. As long as this doesn’t happen,” Piñeiro reflects now, “I call it Castilian.” The issue has not prospered, however. “We never heard serious proposals in Cordoba to change the name of Spanish for anyone else. No academy or institution has done so,” says SAR sources. “Among the linguists it is common to refer to Spanish or Spanish of America to highlight the phonetic and lexical peculiarities presented by that Spanish. And the defense of the diversity of the language is one of the central objectives of the Association of Spanish Language Academies.” Mexican Jorge Volpi feels comfortable with Spanish and recognizes that there are different Spanish, national and regional. “I would even say that individual, varieties where their wealth lies.” Should we look for a more inclusive denomination? “I don’t see it as necessary: each speaker can choose the one that convinces him the most.” Colombian Hector Abad Faciolince believes it was precisely the leap from Spanish to America that made him Spanish: “Of the various peninsular languages it was the one imposed here even among Galicians, Asturians, Catalans and Basques. From an American (international) point of view it is more normal to call it Spanish, as well as internationally Italian is known as Italian and only internally is it known that, to be more precise, it is Tuscan.” The director of the Cervantes Institute, Luis García Montero, recognizes that as a philologist he prefers Spanish “because the language was not born in Castile, but in an area of coexistence of different languages of the peninsula”. In the emilian glosses, he says, there are also words in Basque. “It was about the evolution of Latin in coexistence with people who needed to understand with neighbors, people who walk between Latin, Basque, Astur, Galician and Catalan.” That's right, he says, he uses both terms. “They’re sister words, even if there are picky people in any family.” Asked again Lola Pons: “I speak Spanish of Andalusia and my way of speaking is not reflected in the venerable (and also politically exploited) Spanish term. When that Castilian left Castile he added grammatical, phonetic and lexical forms of the lateral and southern areas. It has been spoken of as Atlantic or Southern Spanish to name that which unites us to the Andalusians and Americans, it is a common expression of course in the scientific literature, but it is not a glotonym extended socially.” The solution? More than sisters, Fernández-Ordonez calls them synonyms. “Tolerance must prevail and each speaker should choose the one he or she prefers. I don't see any sense in changing the name of the language. This one's full of synonyms. Would we have to suppress them in all cases? In addition, language changes do not occur by decree. There is no institution or group capable of changing the name with which speakers refer to a reality. If anyone wants to promote it, go ahead. But I’m skeptical.”","The name of the Spanish language has generated a lot of controversy in recent years, especially in Latin America.",NEU,0.8654625415802002
01-08-2023,"Eduardo Casanova: “Estaría muy bien acabar con la humanidad”
","The filmmaker abandons himself to pessimism in the days leading up to the premiere of his expected (and acclaimed) second feature film, ‘Pity’ “Today I have had a super sad dream. It wasn't even a nightmare. Only a dream very, very, very sad”, sighs Eduardo Casanova (Madrid, 31), dressed in black, in his office, totally painted in black: between the clothes and the wall, the familiar face of the filmmaker and actor is practically a musty floating entity, two blue eyes, huge and dull, immersed in nothingness. “I’m afraid lately,” he continues. “If you stop to think about it coldly, humanity doesn’t look very good. Thinking, or overthinking, something that happens to me sometimes, is not too good because it leads to the real conclusion: things go... regular.” You have to avoid the versallesque airs that someone like Casanova can transmit, thin, angled, immersed in the melancholy between the thousands of kitsch and pop objects that saturate the two floors of his house (dozens of photos of his mother, an imitation Bambi along with a denture-shaped ashtray, a scrotum-shaped vase and walls that are authentic warholian explosions between Bollywood posters, images of Divine and other drag queens and a collection of decorative plates with Chewbacca, Gizmo or the twins of The Shining). That is a simple surface and leads to an already tired topic: the “child of Aida” (Fidel, whom Casanova played during 219 episodes during his adolescence, between 2005 and 2014) in his Neverland, someone with too many possibilities when he discovered the joke of feism and who today continues there, immature and enslaved by the retro, Almodóvar, John Waters or Roy Andersson, behind the backs of the comings and goings of the aesthetics of the world out there. Actually, in this world not all kitsch makes the same joke, not all roses have the same tone, you can mature in Never Ever and, above all, that melancholy is not free. “This film has taken my life ahead of me,” he continues and the two floating eyes fall to the table. “I’m ashamed to say it because I’m aware of my privileges and I know that, many times, and without the intention of being a populist, what leads life ahead is to be a miner or a miner, you know? But I've lost relationships and a lot, a lot of mental health. I thought I had recovered, but now, doing the promotion, I feel sad again.” “This film” is La mercia, his second feature film as director, starring Angela Molina and Manel Llunell, which premieres next Friday in Spain. And the context, actually, couldn't be better. He has already won the award for the best film at some of the world's largest fantastic film festivals (Fantastic Fest, Karlovy Vary and Strasbourg), to which must be added the award of the audience in Montreal and three nominations to the Goyas. Criticism says that it is the best that this unclassifiable author has done, that the inner world he showed in his first work, Pieles (2017) takes on another dimension here, that of a complete artistic vision, capable of maturing, sharpening and offering ideas and images unprecedented in recent Spanish cinema. Pity can be the work that underpins his maturity and consecrates him as visionary. But if he does, it will be in exchange for an expensive toll. “When I started making skins, this office was pink. And when I started writing Mercy, I painted it all black. I think it has a lot to do with it.” 'What would you say happened in between?' 'Well, as Marisa Paredes says in The Flower of My Secret, I evolve and guess I evolve because I am alive. Mercy is certainly not a joyful film. Its main and brighter plot describes the suffocating relationship between a mother (Molina) and her son (Llunell), its attempts to escape from those arms, and the sudden cancer that prevents it. Basically, the journey of a North Korean family trying to escape from Kim Jong-il's regime. It’s a whole universe of tyranny, liberties, affection and poison that captures the artist’s most intimate ideas: “I’m interested in understanding the bad guy, I don’t know exactly what the motive is, which doesn’t mean he agrees with him,” he explains. On the maternal plot, he says: “With Freedom [Angela Molina’s personage], I was afraid of the idea, that we must stop replicating and venerated, of the evil, the evil with power, those Disney villains that we like and enjoy so much. Look, the one I have there.” He points to Maleficent, from La Cinderella, among the nearly hundreds of images that decorate his wall. “It seems that all women with power in the cinema are that, bad. It was very important that Angela’s character, who commits terrifying acts, was profoundly human.” With Kim Jong-il the drive was different. “There is one rather controversial thing about turning images of people who have been or are terrifying into pop,” he admits. “But he was a dictator who wanted to be a film director: he transformed Pyongyang into a set and controlled his people as a cast. I thought it was the perfect connection.” When you talk about this, the look illuminates something and goes to the various books about that country that you have on the shelf. He says that, in fact, he began writing the story on the border with North Korea: “I’ve always been obsessed with that place. It looks a lot like my job, because it’s a very nice place where horrible things happen.” The premiere, he confesses, terrifies him (”I’m just like that for releasing the film,” he says). It's not crazy for Casanova to go back to the public arena. It hasn't always been a nice forum with him. In 2020, as he passed through the red carpet of the Goyas, he took the opportunity to ask for more public investment before a camera to “make anti-fascist culture.” The criticism of the ultra-right rained for days. In 2022, he attended the same ceremony in a pink and black dress, with a large ribbon, designed by Jaime Álvarez, of the firm Mans Concept. He received so many homophobic messages (from “sidoso” up) that he filed a lawsuit with the National Police. He doesn't rule out this inquina coming to him, at least in part, because he's an effeminate man. But all this seems like a footnote to him. He does not share the generational obsession with being perceived as a referent. “I don’t want to make myself here The Passionary or a martyr. I'm a pretty privileged person. If I have to suffer a little and someone has done well, because it is very good because, look, here I am, in my house, the heating on, I have carpet. It’s okay,” he explains. “I never thought I would be considered someone controversial. I didn’t do it for any kind of struggle, but because I feel comfortable dressing like this.” His, he insists, is another thing: “My religion is art and honesty with my own work,” he insists. Apply this conclusion also to the queer militancy in your cinema. “The most homosexual thing in my stories is me,” he says. “Not all LGBTI people have to be smart activists, nor do women who are now lucky to be leading have to make explicitly feminist films. If you want yes and feminist you always have to be. But one thing is social commitment and another is the personality of each one. My point of view is queer, what happens is that I have it so internalized that it's not the center of history. I can’t sit and write if you’re going to offend someone, it’s just an artistic expression.” A position is allowed: that the ultra-right does not see, please, Mercy. He openly asks for it. “This film is like a son: I wouldn’t want to take my son to an Opus school. Well, to protect the film, I don’t think it’s bad to get rid of a certain kind of audience,” he says. It'll be for the movie or whatever, but motherhood is your favorite metaphor today. And also the way that severity gets back in his eyes and he fights back with the state of the world. “Maternity is a very complex issue. I question myself very much if it is reasonable to bring a child into the world today. What's that person thinking? Bring someone right now? To this world? I understand the animal instinct to reproduce like any species, like any virus. But it is a completely selfish act: your son, son or daughter is going to live a horrible world. And you bring him in without asking him if he wants to come.” 'Does that loss of control seem serious to you?'That's why suicide [recurring theme in Skins and Mercy] is such a big problem today. I've thought many times about killing myself. So many. 'To the displeasure of the people who like me?' 'I don't like me so much. –There are groups that advocate directly to let us become extinct, more en masse. 'It would be very good to put an end to humanity.' But since we're a fucking virus, it's not gonna happen. Even if there is a horrible war, which already exists; even if we are dying, we die, we will reproduce. It is curious how the human being will fight until the end of his days for a freedom that does not exist. For a peace that does not exist. All out of love for your children. It's horror. Also in Mercy the world is a horror, but a personal horror, hyperstylled and controlled. It serves as both a relief and a refuge for those who created it. And there may be a clue to the descent that Casanova is suffering now. “In real life you cannot justify certain acts or understand them too much. Some have no explanation,” he says. “But art is the place where you can look for the answer to things that have no explanation, invent the answer, and create your own world almost as an escape. To live in a much more comfortable place for the same thing as real life.” Now, that place lets go of his hand. It goes from something he has created to something he must see go. Like any son. The “very, very, very sad” dream of any mother.","Eduardo Casanova, best known for his role in the TV series Neverland, is a man who is afraid.",NEU,0.7274299263954163
01-08-2023,"Ascenso y descalabro de las exclusivas en la prensa rosa española: del bebé de Massiel y el toples de Lady Di a la ruptura de Isabel Preysler
","Forty-five years ago, celebrities started charging for talking about their private life, turning those stories into a million-dollar business. Today, with the rise of digital media and social networks, the model is in a process of conversion “I was the first to win Eurovision, the first to represent Bertolt Brecht with Fernando Fernán Gómez and the first to represent Antonio and Cleopatra of Shakespeare in Mérida,” Massiel (Madrid, 75 years old) says to EL PAÍS. “When it comes to talking about artistic careers, if you want to talk,” continues the singer before concluding the talk. He does not want to talk about the other issue in which he pioneered in Spain. On June 18, 1977, La, la's interpreter presented it on the cover of ¡Hola! his newborn son, Aitor, as a result of his relationship with socialist politician Carlos Zayas, who had just been elected deputy in the first democratic elections after 40 years of dictatorship. “Great exclusive. The child was born on June 1st at Westminster Hospital in London,” the magazine titled. On that day, the Spanish heart press gave birth to its first exclusive for payment. The report was an informative bombshell, the culmination of nine months of expectation, rumors and conjecture. The artist had had to give birth in the United Kingdom because divorce was not yet legal in Spain and she was still married to surgeon Luis Recatero, who, if he wanted, could claim paternity. That front page sparked a heated debate in public opinion. Massiel was criticized for putting a price on her baby's photos, but she laid the foundation for a new model that revolutionized social chronicle. Until then, the cache paper had been moved by the exchange of favors (you give me a report now and I get you well when you debut in your next movie or play). Suddenly, they changed the rules. And the famous Spaniards liked the new game. In July 1977, a few weeks after Massiel's exclusive, actress Victoria Abril sold the images of her secret wedding to Chilean footballer Gustavo Laube to the Brother Press agency, which in turn sold them to Diez Minutes magazine. “We paid almost nothing. It’s just that Victoria didn’t have any money and wanted to buy herself a washing machine and a fridge,” said Angel Llamazares, director of the agency. On August 20 of that year, Jimmy Giménez-Arnau and Merry Martínez-Bordiú, granddaughter of dictator Francisco Franco, sold the photographs of their link to Hello!. Javier Osborne, then director of Ten Minutes, bought the couple the report of his honeymoon. “Merry and Jimmy’s wedding marked a before and after. His was the first exclusive of a wedding,” recalls Jaime Peñafiel (Granada, 90 years old) in conversation with this newspaper. “But the idea wasn’t mine,” Giménez-Arnau himself explains (Brazil, 79 years old). “If it had been mine, I would have registered it. The merchant was my brother-in-law, Francis Franco. One day he came to see me and Merry and said: ‘Would you mind doing a story for Hello!? They will pay you a million pesetas,” adds the talker and journalist. Less than a decade later, the exclusives business was already moving millions in Spain. The death of Antonio Sánchez Gomez, founder of ¡Hola!, in February 1984, sparked a media war. Not only had he invented the country's best-selling news magazine, but also a new journalistic genre, with friendly, optimistic stories of human interest. He called it “the foam of life.” Shortly after his death, Jaime Peñafiel, who had been one of his closest collaborators, founded La Revista, edited by Grupo Z, editor of Tiempo e Interviú. The new weekly burst like a rocket into the kiosks. The rivalry between heads and between agencies sparked a brazen price struggle to see who got the most sensational story. In 1984, Massiel took an important sum for the first of his wedding with Pablo Lizcano and Gabriel García Márquez as a witness, while Carmen Sevilla did the same for her liaison with businessman Vicente Patuel, celebrated in 1985. That year, Isabel Pantoja pulverized records with her first interview after Paquirri's tragic death in Pozoblanco. According to him, the testimony of the “widow of Spain” would have cost 20 million pesetas. The heart news auction even went into newspaper publishers. “The information is not sold, the information is obtained,” Abc published in 1985. “Paying the interested parties to guarantee an exclusive damage to information pluralism”, continued the newspaper, which demanded that the Madrid Press Association take letters in the matter. In September of that year, Luis Apostua, president of the association, convened a meeting with the directors of the six most important society magazines, who had control of a business with more than 10 million readers. Apostua, who had participated in the drafting of article 20 of the Constitution, concerning freedom of information, had a goal: to reach a pact between gentlemen so that everyone would stop paying the celebrities. Eduardo Sánchez Junco, director of Hello! and son of the founder of the magazine; Jaime Peñafiel, director of La Revista; Jesús Manuel López Campos, de Ten Minutes; Luis González Linares, de Semana; Julio Bou, de Leácciones; and José Llongueras, de Garbo, were summoned to a meeting that finally ended without agreement. Some stars of the moment, such as Paloma San Basilio, Rocío Dúrcal and Júnior, Rocío Jurado and María José Cantudo, remained incorruptible in the face of the purchase-sale of first fruits on their lives. But a large part of the characters in the show were carried away by this fever: Isabel Preysler, Carmen Ordúñez, Carmen Martínez-Bordiú, Amparo Muñoz, Miguel Bosé, Sara Montiel... On September 22, 1985, Rosa Montero published in EL PAÍS a report on the phenomenon. “Something is happening in the magazines of the heart, something has changed. The sale of exclusives was discussed earlier, but the last 12 months have led the situation to paroxysm,” he said in a report entitled Subasta de corazones. “Everyone, famous, not famous, seems to think they have something to sell, a piece of anatomy, a kiss in appearance stolen, a very rolly son, a scandal,” wrote the journalist, who spoke of “a price inflation” of celebrities. Agustín Trialassos, a veteran journalist in the sector, complained: “I used to have my characters, who cared for them, and who gave me news. But lately nobody wants to give you anything because everyone wants to collect.” The bubble hit the roof in 1994 with photos of Princess Diana of Wales in toples taken while on vacation in Malaga. The Europa Press agency offered the world exclusive to the English press for £1 million (about 200 million pesetas). Hello! went out to the rescue of Lady Di, who had just separated from Charles of England, acquiring the rights of the snapshots. The negatives were stored in a drawer and the actual nude never saw the light. The emergence of the Internet, in the mid-1990s, hit the business. “The rise of the web and social networks has made the concept of a single owner news very complicated. Now, digital people are updated 24 hours a day and the characters control their stories through Instagram, Twitter and TikTok, so getting a news story owned by a single medium, which is controlled and broadcast by a single medium for a certain time, is an almost impossible mission,” explains Sandra Aladro, director of Gtres, the leading agency in this sector. “At 10 minutes any news is old because everyone has already replicated it on their websites. Authorship and exclusivity have been diluted and that makes many not compensate for the effort to spend money on a scoop,” continues Aladro, who points out another factor that has devalued the model: the crisis of the paper industry. “Sales have fallen, advertising investment has declined and everyone has less money to pay for a story,” he says. Some magazines, such as ¡Hola!, resist the attacks of the internet publishing great stories of their usual characters—see the recent exclusive of the breakup of Isabel Preysler and Mario Vargas Llosa or, last Tuesday, that of the reconciliation of Tamara Falcó e ñigo Onieva—and incorporating new faces of the Internet world and networks such as influencers —Maria Pombo, Alex Rivière, Marta Lozano...—. Other headlines feed mainly on the private life of Telecinco's stars and, more specifically, on the Universe Save Me, but also on the sentimental vicissitudes of the contestants of reality shows. “Everything has been devalued, including the characters. We no longer have those great characters of aristocracy, royalty or cinema who traveled the world or taught their homes. That was the foam of life, the essence of the pink press. Now there is very little foam left,” says Sandra Aladro. “The sector has fallen a lot. The exclusives feed on meat from women and men and vice versa,” laments Jimmy Giménez-Arnau. “The epidemic of the exclusive, since that child of Massiel and Jimmy’s wedding, has spread through the Spanish professional landscape to almost institutionalized and turn our country into a paradise for those who have it very clear: the fast, easy and abundant money,” says Peñafiel, who concludes that the model shows some signs of exhaustion, but it remains in force.

01-08-2023,"McCarthy y el Congreso, rehenes de Trump y los radicales
","The dramatic spectacle of the election of the Speaker of the House of Representatives augurs for a dysfunctional and conflicting “DT” legislature. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Donald Trump's closest congressmen, was holding her phone to the desperate one of the rebel Republicans after Kevin McCarthy's 14th defeat in the vote to be elected president of the House of Representatives. The one on the other side of the line, as those initials on the screen revealed, was the former president of the United States. According to McCarthy, his calls were decisive. The Republican leader was finally elected speaker, but after paying a high price in the form of concessions to the most radical wing of his party. He has achieved the position, but after plaiting Trump and bowing to the ultras, of whom he is held hostage. And with McCarthy, the Republican Party, Congress, and U.S. governance are hostages. The election put an end to a week of unprecedented political drama in Washington for a century, but it marks the beginning of a two-year legislature that augurs stormy and dysfunctional by the power shown by extremists. The twenty radicals prefer to play against and engage in agitation and propaganda rather than take action or pass laws. The new Republican leader was elected in a session that began on the day of the second anniversary of the assault on the Capitol. According to Democratic Congressman Pete Aguilar in the plenary session, they assume command “the same individuals who fueled the flames of January 6, who told their followers and followers of their followers that they needed to counterattack and that they defied the swearing of the members based on a false claim” about the presidential elections in which Biden defeated Trump. The rebels have demonstrated strength and have taken away from McCarthy some privileged posts and regulatory modifications to the functioning of the House, but also substantial concessions, especially in the area of debt and public spending, which can condition the second half of the term of office of the President of the United States, Joe Biden. The Republicans will also try to turn the House into a hellhole for Biden with investigations and appearances about the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, the control of migration on the border with Mexico and what they consider a partisan use of the Department of Justice, in reference to cases that dot Trump. Congress is already divided. Democrats control the Senate and Republicans have a majority in the House of Representatives. Passing any law or authorization of public spending will require the contest of Democrats and Republicans, which was already predicted to be complicated. But, in addition, once the hard wing of the Republican Party has shown its power in the House of Representatives, Biden's room for manoeuvre has narrowed further and it is in doubt that even essential laws to finance the functioning of the Administration can go ahead, although the president faces the situation with a spending package of 1.7 trillion dollars recently approved. In addition to trumpists, many of the dyscoli, grouped in the Freedom Caucus (Freedom Group), are heirs to the Tea Party and its draconian positions on public spending, which even threaten the continuity of military support to Ukraine. The United States can continue to function normally if new laws on arms, abortion or climate change are not passed, but if budget allocations are not approved or the debt ceiling is raised, the result can be a full-fledged economic crisis. In the United States, Congress sets the limit of living public debt that can be issued by the federal government and when it approaches that level, it is necessary to expand it to avoid the unthinkable, that the country goes into suspension of payments. Economists estimate that the current limit can be reached in the second half of this year. One of the most prominent rebels, Texan Chip Roy, has suggested that his faction has uprooted McCarthy from a commitment to tie the increase in the debt ceiling to imposing spending cuts on the Biden government. The renewal of agricultural subsidies is also coming, which is usually done on a five-year basis. Although in principle it is a program that benefits rural districts with a Republican majority, radicals may again demand a price to pass them. To this is added other concessions initially accepted by the candidate for public spending approval: that each time a new game is approved it must be cut off from the other side. And other measures to ensure that, in the event of a government closure, i.e. the abolition of federal services due to lack of funding, further cuts are needed to unlock it. The United States has never in its history failed to honour its debt commitments, and the government's closing precedents point to turning against those who provoke them. But given the propensity to bring to an extreme its demands that extremists have made clear, it is a risk that cannot be ruled out. It is, again, a kind of blackmail, the same kind that McCarthy has been subjected to in order to give him the presidency of the House, and it can bring back to the Chamber dramatic and chaotic scenes such as those seen this week. These scenes have been broadcast live as never before by the C-SPAN channel, which provides the Congressional signal. The speaker sets the rules for retransmissions, which are normally limited to plans of those who have the floor and general shots of the House. However, with the power vacuum due to the lack of president, C-SPAN's cameras and filmmakers have been free to offer the congressmen's comings and goings, their discussions and even a scene in which McCarthy's ally Mike Rogers was held by another Republican colleague when he seemed willing to reach hands with Matt Gaetz, who denied the candidate the decisive vote in the 14th vote. It was the most tense moment. Gaetz, top exponent of the Never Kevin group, had not attended the first call and his vote was decisive. He said “present”, the equivalent of one abstention. McCarthy, who needed a yes, rose up upset and approached Gaetz's seat with few friends' faces to try to convince him to change his vote, as he was on time. The other Republicans also pushed him, but there was no way. McCarthy went back to his downed seat. The Republicans asked to postpone the session until Monday, but while voting on the proposal, the phones began to smoke. Donald Trump had mobilized. The discoilers transferred McCarthy that if the vote repeated he would be elected. That's right. As he left the Capitol, McCarthy thanked Trump “especially.” This one corresponded to him this Saturday from his social network: “It has been a great honor.” Follow all international information on Facebook and Twitter, or on our weekly newsletter.","A week of unprecedented political drama in Washington for a century, but it marks the beginning of a two-year legislature that augurs stormy and dysfunctional by the power shown by extremists.
