01-02-2023,"El refuerzo de las tropas de Estados Unidos en Rota no se votará en el Congreso 
","Defense and Foreign Affairs believe that the arrival of two new destroyers, starting in 2024, does not require reform of the agreement Spain and the United States will sign in the first months of this year the agreement that will regulate the deployment to the naval base of Rota (Cadiz) of two new missile launchers, announced by the US president, Joe Biden, and the head of the Spanish government, Pedro Sánchez, during the visit that the first made to Madrid in June, on the occasion of the NATO summit, according to government sources. It is expected that the first of these two ships, each with 300 crew members, will arrive in Spain in 2024 and the second, the following year or in 2026, according to the schedule advanced to the Spanish authorities by the US Department of Defense. Although the incorporation of the two new destroyers, who join the four already stationed on the Gaditan base, will mean an increase of 50% in the presence of Navy in Spain, the Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs, directly involved in the negotiation, consider that it does not require reform of the current defense agreement with the United States and can be done through a mere administrative agreement. Therefore, unless the criterion is changed, it is not planned to subject the increase of troops to the ratification of the Courts, contrary to what was done with the previous three amendments to the convention — in 2002, 2012 and 2015 — but only to inform them of it. This decision will avoid the image of the two government partners voting divided in Parliament — united Podemos has already advanced that it will not support the reinforcement of the US military presence in Spain — although it will have to be approved in the Council of Ministers, where both sit. However, not addressing the reform of the military agreement with Washington will have a side effect: the current text, which expired in May 2021, cannot be extended. The United States-Spain Defence Cooperation Agreement was signed in December 1988, with an eight-year term, but the first two times it was reformed (to regulate the performance in Spain of the US Navy and Air Force secret services and to include the arrival of the first four destroyers in Rota) it was extended for the same period, extending until May 21, 2021. Since then, article 59.2 of the Convention has been applied, according to which it is automatically extended for annual periods if, six months before its completion, neither party denounces it. As it was not reported before November 21, it has been extended until May 2024. Having the U.S. Armed Forces as tenants on a contract that expires every year can cause legal uncertainty, but the sources consulted maintain that Washington knows that Spain is a strong ally and that this bond will not change even if the party in the government does. From the legal point of view, the issue is controversial, since the bilateral agreement has the status of an international treaty for Spain, (although not for the United States) and requires the approval of the Courts. The enumeration of the units highlighted in Rota appears in an annex, but this is part of the convention itself, as specified in article 69.1, which is why the arrival of the four ships was submitted to Congress for ratification. However, the second amendment protocol, which authorized the deployment of the destroyers, states that the two countries “may conclude developing administrative agreements” of the same, “as necessary, provided that these agreements are in conformity with the convention and the respective national laws”. Government sources interpret this article as meaning that an “administrative agreement” could serve as an umbrella for the strengthening of Rota (Cadiz). Other sources add that, in any case, the United States personnel ceiling set in the Rota base agreement would not be exceeded: 4,250 military personnel and 1,000 civilians. In September 2021, the actual presence of Americans was limited to 3,200 military and 450 civilians, 70 per cent of what was authorized. Neither would the six destroyers ever be simultaneously in Rota, they add, as there is always more than one sailing or dry dock, by breakdown or maintenance. If the government chose to submit the arrival of the new destroyers to Congress, it could not count on some investiture partners and would probably depend on the PP for approval. Although it is unthinkable that Alberto Núñez Feijóo boycotted military cooperation with Washington, the bridges between the executive and the opposition's first party are broken and mistrust dominates, even on state issues. Beyond the political debate, there is the economic one. The increase in the number of destroyers will involve more work for the shipyards of Navantia, to which Navy has awarded the maintenance of its ships in Rota for a maximum of 822 million euros until 2028.","The Spanish government has decided not to reform the military agreement with the United States, which will increase the presence of Navy in Spain by 50%.",NEU,0.9207597970962524
01-02-2023,"El nuevo año traerá más subidas de precios pese a las medidas sociales del Gobierno
","The energy bill and the basket of the purchase will again become expensive in 2023, with increases in quotes, new taxes and rising mortgages The new year augurs for old evils for the Spanish economy. Prices will continue to skyrocket in 2023, an increase that will not be offset by rising wages and incomes, except for retirees. For this reason, most households will find it more difficult to reach the end of the month. To alleviate these perverse effects, the Government has launched a battery of measures that will benefit particularly the most vulnerable families and, to a much lesser extent, the middle classes, from the reduction of VAT to basic food, the limitation of the price of rents or free subscriptions and discounts for public transport. The effects of the war in Ukraine and the collapses of the pandemic are plaguing the economy in the form of a price hike that has not been known in the last 30 years. Inflation ended in 2022 at 5.8%, after being moderated in the last part of the year driven by energy and food costs, although prices rose by an average of 8.4% throughout the year. Electricity and gas receipts have increased by more than 30 per cent despite reductions in various taxes associated with invoices. Prices won't stop next year. The Banco de España expects the CPI to grow by 4.9% in 2023. Interest rates have also been overflowing, with the eurobor well above 3%, resulting in a rise in the price of most mortgages, and it is expected to continue to rise by 2023 to 4%, following the elimination of the zero-rate policy of central banks to contain inflation. Electricity and gas. After the most convulsive year in the history of energy markets, in which light, gas and fuels have pulverized all their records, 2023 should mark a turning point. The cheaper electricity in this final stage of the year is the appetizer of what should be coming in the coming months: compared to the more than 200 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) of the year that ends, the futures point to somewhat lower values for the incoming exercise, in the environment of the 175 euros. The year, however, will go from less to more: the derivatives market points to a first and second quarters of relatively low prices and a second half clearly upwards. The Government's decision to maintain the full tax reduction applied in recent months will contribute to this trend — albeit at the expense of a tax bill that continues to grow. The VAT on light will remain at 5%, after two drops - from 21% - in the last year and a half. The generation tax (7 per cent) will remain on hold. And the special will remain at 0.5%, the minimum allowed by the European Commission, compared to 5.11% before the crisis. The so-called Iberian exception, a mechanism that has managed to separate roads from gas and light, will also continue. It will do so, at least until May, when Madrid, Lisbon and Brussels will have to negotiate its continuity. Its protection, however, will go less and less: the price of the fuel it uses as a reference will go up at a rate of five euros per MWh of gas per month. The first raise, this very Sunday. The great novelty of 2023 in the electricity market, however, will be the entry into force of the new regulated market tariff – also known as PVPC – which promises to de-link the receipt of short-term price volatility to a long-term basket, similar to what has been happening for years in most surrounding countries. If this new calculation system had entered into force, the axe of receipt for households receiving this rate would have been much less abrupt. And much more time-deferred. In the gas market, the last resort tariff (TUR) will remain the main protection mechanism against endless price escalation on the free market. Although it will rise by 8.7% on average from this Sunday, the regulated market will continue to be between two and three times more economical than those that energy has in its offer catalogues. The price of butane, meanwhile, will remain limited — as from the middle of last year — to a maximum of EUR 19.55 per cylinder. In both cases, the next review will take place on 1 April. Tax hikes and descents. Tax reform will not come in 2023, but there will be many new tax developments. The Government has given a green light both at lower levels and at tax increases for the coming year, in which elections will be held at all levels. The last major measure, recently approved in the decree on anti-crisis measures, is the reduction of VAT to basic necessities. Basic products such as bread or milk will be exempted in practice, as they will be taxed at 0 per cent; pasta and oil will be taxed at a rate of 5 per cent instead of the current 10 per cent. This discount is part of the decree to mitigate the economic impact of the war in Ukraine, and will remain in effect for six months or until May 1 if the March year-on-year rate of underlying inflation — cleared of energy and fresh food prices, the most volatile — falls below 5.5 per cent. The Budgets of 2023 are also burdened with fiscal changes. One of the most prominent is the reduction of the IRPF for the lowest incomes, a measure that the Executive has announced after several communities deflated the autonomous section of the tribute. Instead of using the same solution at the state level, the Treasury has increased the return reduction from €18,000 to €21,000, with an estimated cost of about €1,881 million for the public coffers, arguing that in this way it will not benefit high incomes — as is the case with deflatation. According to the Ministry's estimates, a childless worker who charges €18,000 gross would save €746 per year. In 2023, the reduction in direct self-justification costs from 5 per cent to 7 per cent will also be extended, there will be an additional 5 per cent reduction in net output of modules, and the VAT on female intimate hygiene products and contraceptives will be reduced to 4 per cent. The 2023 accounts also incorporate tax increases. The rate of savings in the IRPF rises from 26% to 27% of the 200,000 euros above, and a new tranche is introduced above the 300,000 euros taxed at 28%. Company tax will be limited to 50%, in 2023 alone, the possibility of compensating the losses of the subsidiaries of the consolidated groups. The tax credit is not lost, but is postponed. According to the Treasury, it will affect 0.2% of companies, and will provide about 2.4 billion to the Treasury. On the other hand, the nominal tax rate will fall from 25% to 23% for SMEs with turnover below the million, with a cost of around 290 million. The Government has also updated the maximum coefficients of the municipal surplus value tax, which is paid by the person who sells, inherits or receives a property as a donation for the extra profit allegedly obtained by the revaluation of the land. These are caps that are reviewed each year, which vary depending on the age of the acquisition and that the municipalities have a certain margin to change. Multiplied by the cadastral value of the land, they form the tax base. In 2023, overall, they increase for acquisitions between 5 and 13 years ago and for short-term transmissions, while the multipliers associated with purchases made in full housing bubble are reduced. New taxes. 2023 will also be the year of extraordinary taxes. Congress has approved three new temporary charges for 2023 and 2024, claiming that they will help finance anti-crisis measures in the context of high inflation. Two of these will be applied to banking and energy, sectors that according to the Treasury are making extra profits thanks to rate increases and the increase in energy prices. Both taxes - which are in fact public property benefits - will nevertheless apply to income. The banking tax will tax 4.8% of the interest margin and commissions of the entities that exceeded 800 million between the two concepts in 2019. For energy - in this case the threshold is 1 billion turnover, always in 2019 - the surcharge will be 1.2%. Finance initially estimated to raise some 7 billion overall, but the figure has fallen to about 6.5 billion because in parliamentary processing some matters were excluded from the orbit of the tributes. Both sectors have announced resources. The third extraordinary tribute is the solidarity tax on large fortunes, which taxpayers who in 2022 had a wealth of more than three million euros will have to pay. In this case too, there has been a quarrel, but one of a political nature. In Spain there is already a tax on wealth, the tax on wealth, which is transferred to the communities. They can modify it and even stop collecting it, as Madrid already does and will do in 2023 Andalusia through a 100% bonus. The new surcharge on the rich eliminates this autonomy in practice and imposes an indirect harmonisation, as it will apply to the same tax bases and will have rates similar to the autonomous tax. To avoid double taxation, the latter will be deductible from the solidarity tax, which will have a rate of 1.7 per cent to three million, 2.1 per cent between five and ten, and 3.5 per cent for bases above 10 million. Finance estimates that it will affect 23,000 taxpayers and raise about 1.5 billion annually. This 2023 will also apply the new taxes on single-use plastic and waste, which will be permanent and which have been delayed for some time despite being required by Brussels. The first - which has set manufacturers and distribution at war - will apply to the production, import and purchase of non-reusable containers, with a surcharge of 0.45 euros per kilogram of non-recycled plastic, and will veto the marketing of single-use products such as straws. The second will tax landfilling and incineration, replacing previously approved regional taxes. Fuels and tolls. The Government has decided to eliminate by 2023 the discount of 20 cents per litre of fuel, which has generally been received by all motorists since 1 April. However, most oil companies (Repsol, Cepsa, Galp, Shell and BP, among others) will maintain a 10-cent bonus for their customers with loyalty card. In addition, they will continue to receive the state subsidy of 20 cents for hauliers, farmers and fishermen. For the motorist, the only good news is that the tolls of the motorways of state competition will only rise by 4%, although the rates of the routes rescued like the radial ones of Madrid will be frozen. Public transport. 2023 will be the year of public transport. The Government and the Autonomous Communities have joined forces to make it as cheap as possible in all its forms. Renfe's free subscriptions for frequent travellers in Cercanías and Media Distancia are extended throughout 2023, although they will have to be renewed every four months, and make at least 16 trips in that period. There will also be a 50% discount on Avant services and some short AVE routes. With regard to urban transport (bus, metro and tram), most citizens will receive a discount of at least 50% on subscriptions, 30% of which will be provided by the State and the remaining 20% by the Autonomous Communities. All the autonomous communities except Andalusia and Asturias, which are studying the measure, have announced that they will apply the discounts. Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands will enjoy a special scheme because public transport will be completely free throughout the year for recurring travellers, when the State assumes 100% of the subsidy. Telecommunications and Post Offices. After years of falling prices due to fierce competition in the sector, telecommunications operators will apply widespread increases in 2023. Vodafone Spain will raise its rates by 8.1% from next January 22, according to the formula of automatically updating its prices to inflation each year. The company estimates that the average increase in the invoice will be 4 euros (2.5 euros for mobile-only contracts and 5.5 euros per month for Internet and mobile packages). The rise will take place just a week after Telefónica raised its prices by an average of 6.8%, which will increase up to 13 euros per month for some of its convergent packages from January 13. MoreMovil has also updated some of its rates although the increases will only affect less than 20% of the 15.2 million customers with which it has, especially second mobile lines contracted in packages of the brands Yoigo, MoreMovil and Virgin with increments of between 1 and 3 euros. Regarding Orange, the company does not rule out a price increase in the coming months, after which it applied in August 2022. The only major operator to maintain its prices is the Romanian Digi, which is currently the fastest growing in the Spanish market thanks to its aggressive tariffs. The increases will also not affect the low cost brands of all operators such as O2 (Movistar), Lowi (Vodafone) and PepePhone, Lebara, LlamaYa and Lyca (MoreMovil). For its part, the price of the ordinary national charter with a weight of up to 20 grams rose 4% on January 1st to 0.78 euros, while the international charters will maintain their rates with respect to 2022. Pensions and salaries. Under the umbrella of the new reform, and despite the inflationary storm, pensions will rise by 8.5% this year, and nearly nine million pensioners will maintain their purchasing capacity. 2023 will, however, be the first year in which the January page will not enter, since the compensatory amount that the Government entered at the beginning of the year to correct the deviation from forecasts is already included in that percentage, which represents the average evolution of the CPI over the last twelve months. With this increase, the maximum retirement pension for this year will be €42,823 gross. Outlined in 14 payments, it will be up to 3,059 euros per month (240 euros more than 2022). As for the minimum, depending on the age of the retired person, and whether or not he or she has a dependent spouse, they will range from €13,526 to €9,694. Non-contributory pensions, which are received by persons who have not met the necessary contribution requirements and are in a situation of need, will be increased by 15%. Less luck will have the rest of the workers. The Government has extended for this new year the minimum wage (SMI), currently set at €1,000 per month, but will apply the new SMI retroactively when the Ministry of Labour agrees this year with the social partners, which the experts put at €1,082. For workers in the private sector, an agreement between employers, trade unions and government has also not been possible as a guide to improving wages by 2023. Representatives of public workers have, together with the Government, defined a three-year road map that will lead to a further improvement in 2023. After 2022 saw an additional increase of 1.5% (which was added to the initial 2%), this year's increase will be 2.5%, but with the possibility of increasing at another additional point depending on the evolution of the CPI and GDP. Along with these increases, there will also be another series of improvements in working conditions that the more than three million public employees have been demanding over the past few years. In order for the two clauses opening the door to an increase of one percentage point to be applied by 2023, the cumulative CPI of 2022 and 2023 would have to exceed 6%. That is, that the average CPI sum for both years exceeds that percentage. Quotations. From 1 January 2023, the so-called Intergenerational Equity Mechanism is applied, which will result in an increase of 0.6% in contributions, of which 0.5% will be provided by the company and 0.1% by the worker. Thus, the rate of contribution for common contingencies will be 28.90%, which will be broken down into 24.10% by the company and 4.80% by the worker. For an average salary (i.e. 2,000 euros of salary and monthly contribution base) it will amount to 12 euros of additional monthly contribution (10 euros of the company's share and 2 euros of the employee's share of the employee's share). For the minimum interprofessional wage (1,000 euros per month) it would be about 6 euros per month more. In the case of self-employed persons, the rate of contribution for common contingencies will also increase from 28.30% applicable in 2022 to 28.90 % applicable from 2023. In addition to this increase in the rate of contribution, the new system of contribution for which the self-employed will pay a social security contribution depending on their income will provide a relief for self-employed workers with lower returns, according to the Ministry of Social Security. Although the deployment of this new framework is planned to be completed within nine years, for the time being the Government and autonomous organizations have only defined the contribution scheme for the next three years. Thus, in 2023, self-employed workers with a net return below 670 euros will pay 230 euros per month, will pay 225 in 2024, and 200 in 2025. In the high section, above 6,000 euros, they will pay 500 euros in 2023, 530 in 2024 and 590 in 2025.

01-02-2023,"El presidente Lula da Silva: “El amor venció al odio. ¡Viva Brasil!”
","The president signs decrees to combat hunger, deforestation and restrict weapons after taking possession of a human tide gathered in Brasilia When on Sunday afternoon Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, 77, arrived as head of the Brazilian State at the presidential palace of Planalto, in Brasilia, received him a gigantic crowd dressed in red with a roar of ecstasy. The emotion reserved for those who have transformed the lives of millions of their compatriots. They dreamed of this moment years ago. Waiting a few hours under the incremental sun of the capital was the least. “Love overcame hatred. Viva Brasil!” proclaimed the president in his second speech of the day, the most meaningful, the one dedicated to his compatriots. The former worker and union leader was moved to tears when he spoke of the misery suffered by millions of Brazilians. His predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, in the United States, did not attend the ceremony. Lula promised to fight relentlessly against the inequality that plagues a country that he already presided over between 2003 and 2010. He recalled that the richest 5% of Brazilians accumulate the same income as the remaining 95%. Brazil lived this New Year a political moment that would have been unimaginable not so long ago. As Brazilians like to remember, politics here is one of those that delights any screenwriter. Both in word and in his gestures, the new president of Brazil insisted on several ideas: one, he will govern for all Brazilians, those who voted for him and those who did not; two, he will pay special attention to those who have the least, those who need the State to guarantee them mere survival (the distribution of income was the mark of their two previous mandates); and three, victory on this occasion is not a personal achievement or of the Workers Party (PT), but of the broad front that he managed to forge with former adversaries. Only then did he succeed in defeating 67-year-old Jair Messias Bolsonaro, and it was by little: only 1.8 points. The president reminded the deputies that 20 years ago, after his first victory, he said in his speech that the mission of his life was for each Brazilian to make three meals a day. “That I should now repeat that commitment today in the face of the advance of misery and hunger, which we had overcome, is the most serious symptom of the devastation of recent years.” His priority now, he said, will be to rescue 33 million Brazilians who suffer from hunger, and 100 million from poverty. After the ceremony, Lula signed the decrees with the first steps. It began by guaranteeing the payment of a monthly aid of R$600 for 21 million poor Brazilians. Others restrict the sale of arms, reinforce the fight against deforestation or lift the secret imposed by Bolsonaro on official matters, among other measures. Following the ceremony from a palace hall in Planalto, 26-year-old Rosa Amorim, a member of the PT in the State of Pernambuco, is exultant. “Today Brazil regains its hope. Lula is the dream of a Brazil for everyone,” said this young woman from the Landless Workers Movement who two decades ago was already campaigning for Lula, who was born in her region. His parents followed a moment of enormous significance for this family from the other side of the street, with the people, in the crowded Plaza de los Tres Poderes of Brasilia. About 300,000 people participated in the big party, which included concerts before and after the ceremony. Excited, the 32-year-old Sunamita Priscilla cleaning employee also attends. Meet Lula with a closeness that few enjoy. He worked at the presidential residence during the last year when the former metalworkers were president, before leaving power, in 2010. Then he worked “with Doña Dilma, with Mr. Temer, and with him,” he says in reference to Bolsonaro. Evangelical, he asks “God to guide him on the way because the thing is not easy.” The vice president, Geraldo Alckmin, played an enormous role in the ceremony. Lula arrived in a convertible Rolls Royce, but, contrary to tradition, he was accompanied by Alckmin and the wives of both. It was his way of emphasizing that Bolsonaro’s “Government of National Destruction” lost the elections thanks to an unprecedented coalition to the left and right of the PT. Alckmin is a figure of the classic center-right who lost the 2006 elections to Lula, voted in favour of impeachment and who is now “partner Alckmin”. The guests who followed the ceremony from the palace of Planalto reflect magnificently the change in Bolsonaro's departure. Instead of a panorama starring white men in suit or uniform, the attendees were a more faithful reflection of Brazilian society, with many women, young black women, some women dressed in white with spectacular headdresses, followers of the religions that bequeathed to Brazil their ancestors, enslaved Africans, several indigenous with their headdresses and paintings or a drag queen with a spectacular red dress. Brazilians who during Bolsonaro's term have not felt at ease in their country because the head of state was determined to attack them and dismantle the policies built over the last years or decades to protect them. Bolsonaro, always determined to treat Lula as an enemy, did not attend the ceremony. He's been in the United States since Friday after two months in which he's been practically mute.

01-02-2023,"Alex Honnold a vida o muerte: sale a la luz el vídeo más estremecedor del escalador estadounidense 
","Eleven years after filming the American's toughest single integral in Yosemite, filmmaker Peter Mortimer shares it for free In 2011, American climber Alex Honnold climbed a 40-meter track called The Phoenix, located in the Californian Yosemite Valley, in a single integral (i.e., without rope). The news went without pity or glory only to the specialized media. Despite this, no one had ever been able to climb in this way so committed a route as difficult, graduated as 7c+ on a scale running between the fourth and ninth grades. To better understand this complexity, it suffices to say that the vast majority of climbers never reach this degree of difficulty by climbing, of course, with the protection of the rope. Honnold himself, however, would reach world fame in 2017 after climbing the El Capitan Freerider track, also located in Yosemite: almost a thousand meters of wall without using the security of a rope. The feat, recorded in the documentary Free Solo, won an Oscar in 2019. None of Freerider's 33 long (or sections) is as difficult as the Phoenix track. Eleven years later, producer Reel Rock has been surprised by the spread of an eight-minute short that captures that ascension to The Phoenix, one of the most amazing moments in the history of climbing and that causes equal disbelief and unrest. The work, filmed and co-starred by Peter Mortimer (the author of two of the best climbing documentaries ever filmed: The Dawn Wall and The Alpinist), is a horror film that not knowing that it ends well stops squeezing the nerves of the viewer. The track runs almost parallel to the Cascade Falls waterfall, and is famous for several reasons: the first, its difficulty, an extra-plotted fissure of fingers (which exceeds 90 degrees of inclination compared to the horizontal plane) highly technical. The second problem is that it runs through a granite where the feet find poor adhesion. Locals claim that rock skates and losing the support of a foot is common, and this is something no climber wants to find. And then there's the inconceivable fact of having to assume that when you climb without rope, any mistake can end your life. The route starts on a ledge located in the middle of the wall and can only be accessed by means of a rappel (detaching with the rope) from the top of the wall. That was done that day in June 2011, at dawn, by Alex Honnold and Peter Mortimer. This one stayed right where The Phoenix ends as Honnold slid down the rope, checking the route wasn't wet. A second camera was placed in front of the wall. Once on the shelf, Honnold took off the harness, leftover clothes, sank his hands in the magnesium bag, blew to shake the surplus and abandoned the security of the place to face 40 meters of climbing... to life or death. Peter Mortimer has not explained why he has kept this unique tape so many years in which you can see the ascension in its entirety. I may be afraid of a contagion effect, which climbers without Honnold's physical and psychological abilities venture to climb without rope. Or perhaps the sponsors of the American did not want such publicity. However, a few seconds of this recording could be seen in the program 60 minutes of CBS in October 2011, during which the interviewer asks Honnold why she did not want more audience than Peter Mortimer that day. His answer is eloquent: “I would never have accepted that there was a group of people looking up, and I can assure you that you would not have wished to see him...it would have been so strange, so intimidating, that no one would have been comfortable as a spectator.” Peter Mortimer can attest to this: he seems to suffer much more pressure and anguish than Honnold himself. No one wants to witness a fatal accident. In a moment, while trying to focus the climber's fingers looking for a fastening point on the rock, Mortimer's hands begin to tremble and the plane gets drunk and lost. Mortimer, a European football enthusiast who knows all the statistics of our League, was fortunate enough to witness the feat for a logistical matter: someone had to pull the rope behind the rappel and collect Honnold's material. Honnold is considered to have made more than 1,500 ropeless climbs, 95% of them without cameras or public. The route was free climbing, that is with rope and protections placed on the rock, by Ray Jardine and John Lakey in 1977. Jardine revolutionized the climbing material by inventing the cam recessors, safe to remove and put on the rock that allowed in many cases to dispense with nails to favor a cleaner and faster type of climbing. Prescinding Jardine's invention to flow through the walls is something that not even 1% of all climbers on the planet could do... or wish to do. Alex Honnold has a few fingers of an unusual diameter: they look disproportionate and are both a huge advantage and a problem. In The Phoenix, the key step runs through a fissure that his fingers fill with ease, facilitating its progression, but in a supposedly simpler section, the fissure is so thin that his fingers have little room to slip in, with the consequent tiredness and frightening possibility of slipping. Shortly after completing the ascension, Honnold, very critical of himself, acknowledges having climbed badly: suffering more tension than expected. The camera only collects, on the other hand, fluid and certain movements. And the real possibility of an instant live death.

The essay will decide what the Evau exercises will be like since 2024 Some 2,000 Baccalaureate students from 50 educational centers will participate in the pilot tests of the new Selectivity, exercises that will ask students to apply their knowledge through questions more contextualized with reality, in line with international tests such as Pisa and with the competitive learning that the Lomloe, the new educational law, has introduced. The children will be evaluated, but they will also evaluate the exercises in a certain way: a part of the students, which is not yet concrete but will be “important” according to knowledgeable sources of the works, will be interviewed individually at the end of the exams and will be asked to express their degree of “satisfaction” with the level of optionality of the exercises (the possibility of choosing to answer some questions or others), their structure and other elements. The students' opinion, along with other parameters, such as the functioning of the qualification criteria, the reliability of the correction (e.g. its homogeneity, which can be measured because each exam will be corrected separately by at least three teachers), or how the test is adjusted to the expected duration, will determine the format that the Ministry of Education will generalize in the examinations of the new University Access Assessment (Evau) that will begin to be used from 2024 onwards. For this purpose, although the pilot tests will be carried out on six subjects, in each of the subjects different formats of exercises will be used, which will be presented to different groups of students. Each of the reviews will be analyzed using the above parameters, summarized in reports and compared to choose the most appropriate ones. The fact that these criteria include interviews to measure the “level of adaptability and satisfaction of students with the model of exercise” that has been proposed to them, represents a step forward in the participation of students in the definition of the tools used to evaluate them. In this case, in the most feared test. The exercises of each subject will be structured into three main categories, according to the documentation to which THE COUNTRY has had access. Problem solving (which will account for 50% of the qualification); design or elaboration (in the case of a subject of the scientific branch, for example a communication of scientific results, 30%), and critical analysis (which, following the same example, could be carried out around a journalistic article related to the impact on the health or the environment of a certain habit, 20%). The weighting percentages for each of the three axes may vary from one subject to another. The pilot tests – and the new Selectivity – will give students the opportunity to choose between one third and more than 50% of the questions, depending on the format. An exercise can pose two complex tasks to students, for example, and ask them to answer half of the questions posed below. And another, raise three complex tasks and ask students to choose two, answering all the questions included in these. The tests will define what the new Evau exams will be like since 2024. But while in this essay all questions will be competent, in reality they will be introduced gradually. In the Selectivity 2024, one will be included in the examination of each subject, accompanied by other more traditional questions; in 2025, there will be two... Since 2028, in addition, these new exercises by subjects will live with the new academic maturity test, even more competent, in which the examinations of all the common subjects of the baccalaureate will be subsumed. In the case of the Maturity Test, the ministry will have several years to run pilot tests until it is well polished. In the case of exercises by subject, however, this is the only pilot test planned. The essay will be conducted with students of first high school. The ministry has decided to do so because they are the ones who will premiere the new Selectivity in 2024; they belong to a level that, in theory, should already be learning competently (the Lomloe established that in September the odd courses would begin to do so and a year later, the peers, another thing is that it is really happening), and it avoids distracting the second graded students from a test model that they will not have a few months from their own Evau. The subjects included in the pilotage are those of the first baccalaureate that have continuity in second: Castilian language and literature; Foreign language; Philosophy; Mathematics; Latin, and Artistic drawing. To these six could be added a subject of the musical baccalaureate. In each of the 50 participating schools, pupils will be examined for up to two exercises. The subject History of Spain will not be part of the essay, because it does not exist in first Baccalaureate, it is only given in second. The tests will cover contents that the children have studied in the first half of the course, indicate sources from the Ministry of Education, which emphasize that the pilot tests do not seek to evaluate the knowledge of the children about some contents, but to measure how they face the new exams, which exercise formats are most convenient, and how the correction guides of each test work, which will be written in parallel to homogenize this correction. The pilot tests will be developed by teachers of the working groups that have been preparing the new Evau for months. The groups are divided into subjects and consist of teachers elected by the ministry, the autonomous communities and universities. The correction of the pilot tests shall be carried out by teachers who have not participated in the preparation of the pilot tests. The teachers who will prepare the pilot tests will also make the correction guides and, in light of the result of the essay, the examples of exams of the new Selectivity, already with subjects of second grade, which the ministry hopes to disseminate in June. The planned timetable provides for the completion of the pilot tests in January, the company that organises the tests simultaneously in February (the procedure usually followed in external evaluations such as PISA or PIRLS), and the examinations are held in March. In June, if everything goes as planned, the Royal Decree of the new Selectivity will be published, the examples of exams and the qualification criteria, so that students and teachers know when they begin second grade how the Evau that awaits them will be. The pilot tests will be conducted in 10 autonomous communities, in addition to Ceuta and Melilla (educationally dependent on the Government). The five autonomies that govern the Popular Party announced in November that they would not continue to participate in the preparation of the new Selectivity, thus accepting the order of the party leadership justified by the argument that the Ministry of Education did not accept their request to implement a unique University Access Assessment (Evau) for the whole of Spain. A complex technical and, above all, political step that popular people have never taken when occupying the Government. Sources from the Ministry of Education say that they do not lose hope that PP communities will return to work, but in view of the upcoming electoral calendar, it does not seem likely. The self-exclusion of PP communities has been joined by Euskadi. Although in his case not because of a rejection of the proposed Selectivity model, he is helping to define it in the working groups. The explanation transmitted by the Basque authorities to the ministry is that in 2023 they will re-evaluate their education system, as they have been doing for several years, the previous edition, mediated by the pandemic and incomplete participation of the centers, did not show good results, especially in the public school, generated noise and discomfort, and they do not want to put more pressure on their teachers and students with the pilot tests of the Evau. Aragón has also declined to participate so far, in his case alleging internal difficulties. The Ministry has redistributed pilot tests between the rest of the communities and the autonomous cities. Six centres will participate in Catalonia; in the Valencian Community, the Canary Islands, Castilla-La Mancha, Asturias, Cantabria and La Rioja, five; in the Balearic Islands, four; in Extremadura and Navarre, three; in Ceuta, two; and in Melilla, two others.

01-02-2023,"Las tres caras de Joseph Ratzinger
","Benedict XVI was a progressive theologian, a powerful inquisitor, and a pope defeated by the “wolves” who were in the Vatican curia. “Citizen Braschi, who practiced the profession of pontiff, failed,” wrote the registrar in the municipality of Valence, France, on guard duty in August 1799, about the prisoner who had just died in that city. It was, in fact, a pontiff, Pope Pius VI, a civilian, Count Angelo Onofrio Melchiorre Natale Giovanni Antonio Braschi dei Bandi. He was a man of merit, but had been overrun by the effects of the French Revolution and, above all, by plotting against Napoleon, one of whose generals had been shot shortly before being occupied by Rome by the French army. He saved his life by fleeing the capital of the Pontifical States disguised as a beggar, but was taken prisoner and taken to France. He died as a pontiff; the registrar had no doubt. What will the record of the deceased say about the so-called Pope emeritus Benedict XVI, of civilian Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger? Pontifice emeritus, is it? Also infallible, according to dogma? He himself had his doubts. “I did, but I retained the spiritual dimension of the papacy,” he tells his head biographer, Peter Seewald (Benedict XVI. A life. Messenger. 2020). It appeals to the example of bishops. “Until the Second Vatican Council, there were no abdications of bishops; it is not understood why this legal concept should not apply to the bishop of Rome,” he says. It omits a fundamental aspect. It is Vatican II itself that forces bishops to retire at the age of 75, but keeping the rank of emeritus, that is, with the power to participate in tasks that were his own before his retirement. The council said nothing about the popes: neither that they should retire at a certain age, nor about subsequent functions. If a pope resigns, stop being a pope. There are many bishops (5,377 in the world). Dad can only be one. There is a precedent: one in 2,000 years. It happened in 1294. The cardinals had been in conclave for two years and three months without finding a pope. Finally, they knew that far from Rome, on Mount Morrone, there was an old hermit known as a saint. It was a solution; it wouldn't bother the curia. His name was Pietro Angeleri di Murrone and he took the name Celestino V. The atolondrado monk was to be surprised. Once crowned, he rejected the symbols of imperial power and moved his headquarters to Naples, where he made his way to the back of an ass carried by the kings of Sicily and Hungary. Soon he made provocative appointments: 12 new cardinals, none of them Roman, most of them monks. The curia turned and Celestino V tried to bridge it. To strengthen himself, he would appoint a triumvir. There would be three potatoes. “Christ’s wife has never married three husbands,” they said. He had to give up the idea. He resigned weeks later, foreign to the discussion in which theologians, especially those of the University of Paris, joined. It's hard to believe Ratzinger wasn't aware. What happened next to Celestino V has nothing to do with the situation of the Pope emeritus. Francis has treated him lovingly. Celestino V wasn't that lucky. 10 days after the resignation, the conclave, in a single voting day, elected Cardinal Benedict Caetani, who took the name of Bonifacio VIII. He immediately returned the seat to Rome and made himself accompanied by his predecessor. He managed to escape and tried to flee to Greece. He was arrested and imprisoned. He died three months later. His fame is in literature. Dante places him in hell alongside the neutrals, like Pontius Pilate; Constantine Cavafis cites him in Canon Poems for the transcendence “of the great No”; Ignacio Silone makes him the protagonist of the novel The Adventure of a Poor Christian, and Dan Brown tells in Angels and demons that, by means of X-rays, a nail of 25 centimeters was discovered in the skull of Celestino V. The author of The Da Vinci Code holds that it was Boniface VIII who ordered him to be killed. Apart from the debate on the consequences of his resignation, what remains of Benedict XVI's pontificate are some lights and many shadows. He won the election in the conclave with a phrase: “How much filth in the Church!” He pronounced it at one of the farewell ceremonies of his predecessor and friend, John Paul II, and the cardinals were startled. Ratzinger, powerful prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which is what is now called the sinister Holy Office of the Inquisition, referred not only to the scandals of pederasty, but also to the behavior of the Roman curia before money; the existence of a gay lobby in the so-called Holy See, internal fights for ecclesiastical power and a long etcetera. “How much dirt!” he told them who knew them best. During his tenure he reiterated that he saw his Church as “a vineyard devastated by wild boars.” Earlier, the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, had written that the Pope “was surrounded by wolves”. Two years after his election, he was going to remember the phrase of one of his predecessors, held as German pope (Germany had seven pontiffs before Ratzinger; Spain only two). He referred to Adriano VI, elected without even deigning to go to the conclave (he was regent of Castile waiting for the arrival of Emperor Charles in Spain). When he came to Rome, he gathered the cardinals and spewed out to them: “You are all rascals.” He believed that in Rome cancer had begun, in Rome it had to be removed. When Ratzinger remembered that scene, he was thinking the same thing. “What a mess!” It was consistent and took action. The first, “zero tolerance” in the face of pederasty. The thesis of John Paul II, which Ratzinger reiterated at the Catholic University of Murcia, was that the news about sexual abuse of the clergy, some of high rank, cardinals even, were nothing but the anticlerical press' commitment to discredit it. He went on to claim that in the United States they were the result of the Pope's opposition to the invasion of Iraq. The laundry was washed at home, holding much of the curia. One of his ministers, Antonio Cañizares, later Cardinal Archbishop of Valencia, where he had just retired, came to argue that more serious than child abuse was the decriminalization of abortion. Even worse: it was Ratzinger who ordered the centralization of the cases in Rome, specifically in his Congregation. When he came to office, he ordered the opposite: that each episcopate should act in each diocese. Ratzinger passes into history as a conservative pope and, before that, as an intransigent inquisitor. They are true assessments, no doubt. As a young man, it wasn't either of those things. There are texts that proclaim him as a progressive theologian, alongside the Swiss Hans Küng, of whom he was a friend and who he later punished mercilessly. With the prestige that gave him to have been expert in Vatican II, just after finishing the council he declared himself in favour of suppressing the obligatory celibacy of priests. He even signed a manifesto. “That, of course, was not a lucky decision,” he later acknowledged. He also criticized the encyclical Humanae Vitae, in which Paul VI condemned all contraceptive methods, specifically the popular pill. On the role of women it has not been an advance, but he refused to doctrinally endorse John Paul II's intention to proclaim dogma of faith that women will never be able to access the priesthood. The young Ratzinger also defended the freedom of theologians, claiming that Theology remained “the empress of science.” This is his phrase: “True obedience is not obedience to the flatterers who avoid all shock and put their intangible comfort above all things. What the Church needs are not panegirists of what exists, but men in whom humility and obedience are no less than the passion for truth.” Already in the position of inquisitor cardinal, but also as a pontiff, he maintained the contrary and issued a thousand long theologians, half a dozen Spaniards. “Be magnanimous,” John Paul II used to ask. There is one of Benedict XVI's most notable encyclicals, Caritas in veritate, the phrase that defines that change of face. It is a brutal thought: “Ideological closure to God and atheistic indifference, which forgets the creator and runs the risk of forgetting human values as well, are today presented as one of the greatest obstacles to development. Humanism that excludes God is an inhuman humanism” (The last sentence comes in italics in the original document). His obsessions against relativism –”with the tendency to relativize the real we will end up being a care NGO, but not the Church,” he writes – lead him to the idea that reason is only one, and even at the beginning, that so many crimes have caused humanity, that “mistake has no rights.” In this idea, the doctrinal document Dominus Iesus, issued with its signature on August 6, 2000, raised the principle that outside the Church there is no salvation. Reader of Sartre in his youth, he turns the famous phrase of the existentialist philosopher — “hell is the others” — into a Catholic complaint: The others are to blame. He holds it in his last writing, just four years ago. There are 18 pages of disclaimer about their responsibilities in the crater of pederasty. It all began, he says, in the Europe of the sexual revolution, in the sixties of the last century. “Pedophilia was also diagnosed as allowed and appropriate,” he says. It's his well-known aversion to May '68. The revolts in Paris are famous, but those that Ratzinger suffered in Germany were appalling. Hans Küng recounts in his memoirs that Ratzinger “was shocked” and caused his turn toward the extreme Catholic right. However, the future pontiff was horrified from childhood. In the midst of a dangerously opposed Christian-Democrat family against Hitler, the truth is that, as soon as he was 16 years old, he joined Hitler's youths, swore allegiance to Hitler on New Year's Day in 1943 and was enlisted in the army as an assistant in anti-aircraft batteries. Fragile, almost pungent, tells his biographer that what worried him the most then was that the Nazis would make gymnastics a compulsory subject to enter the university. “His youth was not normal. They returned from the traumatised war and had to assimilate the fact that the greatest crimes in human history had been committed in their name,” concludes Seewald. There is, however, a fact that defines the character of the future Pope. When Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945, Ratzinger was 18 years old, dressed in uniform with the Nazi swastika and decided to return home on his own, without permission, by hitchhiker. “Defection is not a flight or a retreat out of fear, but a reasoned decision. He has already done his part; he has nothing left to do,” says his biographer. It is the same attitude that leads him, many years later, to renounce the pontificate: for yes, without counting on anyone, “only after talking to God”. That's what he said.

01-02-2023,"La capilla ardiente de Benedicto XVI se abre para el último adiós de los fieles
","Hundreds of people line up inside and outside the Basilica of St.Peter of the Vatican to say goodbye to Pope Emeritus. The remains of Joseph Ratzinger will be exposed to the public until the funeral scheduled on Thursday The burning chapel of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who died this Saturday at 95 years old, opened at nine o'clock in the morning in the Basilica of St.Peter of the Vatican for the last farewell of the faithful. Hundreds of people have lined up since 05.30 this morning to access the temple's central nave and pay homage to Joseph Ratzinger. The authorities foresee that about 35,000 people parade through the fiery chapel each of the three days during which it will remain open. The funeral will take place on Thursday morning. The first faithful to enter the basilica were a group of Indian theologians who had been waiting since dawn at the temple gates. But among the first to be able to say goodbye to Benedict XVI, shortly before the doors of the temple were opened to the public, was the Prime Minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, and the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella. Both have paid silent homage to Ratzinger from the side benches of the place where the body of the Pope Emeritus has been placed. The line of faithful waiting to see the remains of the Pope Emeritus already crosses the basilica and goes several times to St. Peter's Square of the Vatican to allow them to wait in an orderly manner. One of the great doubts of an unprecedented fact such as the death of a pontiff emeritus was the funeral rite and the protocol that would be established. The dress provides some clues, since Benedict XVI has been dressed in papal red, but without the pallium: the ornament that is placed around his neck and that indicates the power exercised at the time of his death. The absence of such a piece indicates that the German was justly retired. The other big difference with the death of a regent pope is that next day 5 there will be no state funeral. The only delegations invited in this regard have been German (for the nationality of the pontiff) and Italian, for the link between the Vatican and the host country. But the heads of state or presidents of the government who travel to Rome to fire Ratzinger will do so of their own free will. Joseph Ratzinger's remains were transferred at seven o'clock in the morning to the basilica from the monastery Mater Ecclesiae, where the Pope Emeritus resided since his resignation in February 2013. There he was watched over by friends, citizens and workers of the Vatican, as well as the cardinals and members of the Curia. Cardinal Mauro Gambetti presided over a brief ritual already in the Basilica of St.Peter until 7.40, before finalizing the preparations for the arrival of the faithful.

01-02-2023,"Estados Unidos contra TikTok: el Congreso estrecha el cerco político sobre la red social china
","The ban on members of the House of Representatives from downloading the short video ‘app’ is the latest episode of a technology battle of the cold war between Washington and Beijing The U.S. Congress administrative director sent last Wednesday to stop TikTok’s dance with an internal message that was not open to interpretation: “House employees [of Representatives] are NOT allowed to download that app on work phones. If it turns out that you already have it down, they will contact you to remove it.” Catherine Szpindor argued “security risks” to take the measure, certainly unusual, against a foreign company, and was ahead of the entry into force of the ban on the use of the Chinese-owned social network of videos on federal government-owned devices, except in cases where she served the security forces for their investigations. The veto is included in the monumental spending package of 1.7 trillion dollars (about 1.6 trillion euros) approved in extremis the previous week, before the Capitol launched the closure for Christmas. President Joe Biden signed the law on Thursday, during his vacation in the Virgin Islands. There are already at least 19 states, the majority governed by Republicans, that have resorted to those same security concerns to partially block TikTok on their officials' phones and tablets (Indian went further, suing the company for offering adult content to children). And on December 13, Republican Senator Marco Rubio (Florida) introduced a bipartisan project called Antisocial CCP Act. The name, however much it sounds like a joke (it would be, if not for the passion of American legislators for acronyms), responds to the Chinese Communist Party's National Internet Surveillance Threat, Oppressive Censorship and Influence and Algorithmic Learning Act. Days earlier, in an op-ed in The Washington Post signed with Congressman Mike Gallagher (Wisconsin), Rubio wrote: “The app can track mobile phone locations and collect internet browsing data, even when users visit unrelated websites.” Both also recalled that, according to a 2017 law, Chinese citizens and companies are obliged to share information with the authorities of the country for reasons of national security. “It is disturbing that TikTok, and by extension the Communist Party, has the ability to take note of every time our teenagers use their phones. With that app, Beijing can collect sensitive information from government employees, as well as blackmail or spy on millions of our compatriots.” The story of love-hate between its owners, the ByteDance matrix, and the United States—with 136.5 million accounts, is the country in the world that uses the platform the most—is not new, but it has a peak of hostility these weeks in the context of the growing geopolitical struggle between Washington and Beijing. Former President Donald Trump has already made an attempt in the summer of 2020 to ban the social network, which in 2021 exceeded in visits to Google and which in just six years has simply succeeded in changing the mass culture of this country. Like other numbers from the circus of low passions of his last months in the White House, the thing was half-hearted. Upon his arrival in office, Biden put in a drawer the executive order of his predecessor, which gave 45 days for a local firm to take TikTok in the United States (then, there were plenty of candidates to take such succulent loot). That was not the sign of a drastic change of course: the new Administration has been continuistic with the previous one regarding its policy of technological rivalry with the enemy power. This has meant that, in practice, the platform has been left in limbo, at the expense of an investigation, which has been under way for more than two years, by the Foreign Investment Commission (CFIUS). Belonging to the Treasury Department, she is responsible for monitoring business agreements with non-U.S. companies. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported on the pressure within that Pentagon and Justice Department member commission to force a sale of the company's operating part in the United States as the only solution to the security problems it poses. Christopher Wray, director of the FBI, does not miss the opportunity, for his part, to warn about the dangers of the social network recommendation algorithm and its “capacity to influence.” After learning about Congressional legislative intentions, Brooke Oberwetter, TikTok’s spokesman, called the ban a “disappointment” and “a political gesture that will do nothing to promote national security interests.” The company has repeatedly sought to reduce concerns about its handling of private data, claiming that US users are not stored in China, that such information is not shared with the Government of the Asian country and that its headquarters are in fact in the Cayman Islands. “The agreement that CFIUS is reviewing will significantly address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state levels,” the statement continued. Meanwhile, the firm, especially popular among the younger ones (it is the second in teenagers' preferences, behind YouTube, according to the Pew Research Center analytics center), invests money in pretending to play according to the rules, although evidence is piled up to the contrary: last week, an internal investigation found that several employees of ByteDance had accessed the data of American journalists. Tech's been running an office in Washington for years. And in the populated jungle of city lobbyists, ByteDance has increased its presence at the rate of its growth in the United States: it has gone from investing $370,000 to influencing legislators' decisions in 2019 to spending $4.28 million this year, according to OpenSecrets, a sentinel organization of the relationship between money and power. Veteran cybersecurity expert Brian Grayek, executive of the specialized company REDW and collaborator in several investigations with the secret services and the FBI, believes that the measure recently adopted in Congress is short. “It will not prevent them from continuing to steal information from the rest of the Americans. Some of them could be spouses or relatives of government officials, including having links with the Army, the military industry, critical infrastructure, or U.S. intelligence,” he explains in an email. So he applauds Senator Rubio's initiative. “As it is often said, ‘desperate times require desperate measures.’ It is a software created purposefully with spurious intentions, which has set the new standard to break the rules and corrupt teenagers, meddle in people's lives and spy on citizens. None of this is a conjecture, they are proven facts,” he considers, before offering “two arguments.” “The first: ask 100 TikTok users if they know how their data is handled by the company to which they were delivered, how they spy on their movements, their patterns, their browsing history, their locations, among many other things; or whether they understand how they manipulate their actions and thoughts at their whim depending on their age and country of residence. I estimate that maybe two will tell you that they know some part of that answer. The second reason is that being a popular application does not make it reliable. Almost no one wanted to wear seat belts when they were introduced into cars in 1949. Few employed them after they became compulsory in 1991. Even today there are those who still do not put them on, at the risk of being liable to be fined.” According to that reasoning, many of its users know that they go in a car recklessly driven at full speed and still prefer not to think about their physical integrity. One of them, Victoria Jameson, “Creator of TikTok” with nearly 970,000 followers and author of the podcast of tips “to grow on the platform” TikTalk Radio, is confident that the company and the US government “will be able to reach an agreement.” In a recent episode, he recommended that his listeners “not be overcome by the negative energy of the moment” and continue to upload videos. Also, to make sure to save the content before it could disappear “from night to morning”, as happened in 2016 with Vine, looped short clip service (there, the reasons were purely business). For Jameson, “all this is an unbeatable reminder that creators don’t own their audience.” Nor are politicians, who, however sensitive they may be to security problems, aware that TikTok is an unbeatable way to reach potential (and not always easy to mobilize) Z-generation voters. The White House has wooed prominent influencers to ask them for help in spreading their messages on issues such as U.S. involvement in Ukraine's war or Biden's efforts to reduce inflation. Perhaps the case that best proved that unexplored power in the last legislative years was that of Pennsylvania Democratic candidate John Fetterman. His campaign, during which he suffered a stroke, failed in many respects, but proved masterful in the use of social networks. He has almost 242 million followers in TikTok, and was elected to the Senate in one of the most contentious disputes of the election. His last post is November 13.

01-02-2023,"Arranca el año electoral en el que líderes y partidos se juegan ser o no ser
","The May regional and municipal elections are seen as a primary of the general elections scheduled for December. The formations prepare a strong start to give impetus to a tough and prolonged campaign 2023 is the year in which the future of leaders and parties will be defined. The PSOE is to retain the presidency of nine autonomies, 22 provincial capitals and its continuity in La Moncloa. The PP faces its own expectations: to retain the City Council and the Community of Madrid, to take some regional government from the socialists and to win the generals. We can and Vox will measure their usefulness as key forces to form coalitions and Citizens will test their own survival. The big question is whether or not there will be political change in Spain: whether the right wing (alone or with the support of the extreme right) seizes power from the first progressive coalition government since the restoration of democracy. The end of 2022, with an unprecedented institutional crisis and radical disagreement between the main parties, is the prelude to what is coming. This is recognized in the bridges of command of the formations: an even more political year in the face of dogs, foreseen as a very long campaign that will culminate in the general elections, in principle scheduled for December. There will be no truce, and there is no time to waste. The first flying goal is the regional and municipal elections of 28 May, a decisive election that will make the first round of the generals and whose pre-campaign begins already in January. These are the main keys to that red date marked in the calendar of an electoral year of vertigo. The PP faces 2023 leading the polls, except that of the CIS, and with the autonomic remodeling of the party made without major conflicts. But Alberto Núñez Feijóo has not finished the comfortable year, wrapped in the front line in the institutional crisis due to the PP's blockade of the renewal of the organs of the judiciary. In the party, Pablo Casado's successor is expected to expand his leadership at the start of the year to give impetus to formation in such a crucial course, while in Ferraz and La Moncloa they feel that they have fulfilled the goal they set in summer after the collapse of the PSOE in the Andalusian elections: to counter the Feijóo effect and reach the end of the year with options to revalidate power in the next legislature. The closure of 2022 has been better than expected, with the lowest inflation in the EU — 5.8%, almost half that when it hit the roof in July (10.8%) — and an economy growth that, according to Pedro Sanchez, will exceed 5%. Spain has not entered into a recession, despite uncertainty over the war in Ukraine and its economic and social consequences, to which the Government has allocated 45 billion euros. But the progressives must resolve their problems if they are to avoid a change of cycle: the autonomous and municipal ones arrive in full reconfiguration of the space to the left of the PSOE, with the alliances between Podemos and IU still in the air in most territories, a climate of distrust among the organizations and strong tensions—with threat of rupture—because of the role of the party of Ione Belarra in Sumar, the project that finalises Yolanda Díaz in the face of the generals. The PP is clear that it wants to make municipal and regional elections a national one. “We have to get 8,131 plebiscites on Pedro Sánchez,” sums up one leader, citing the total number of municipalities in Spain. Feijóo will turn to the campaign. Genoa ships up to five large events with the leader's presence at the beginning of the year: two of the candidates' presentation, an intermunicipal forum and another interparliamentary, as well as another great rally that could also have programmatic content. It's about showing muscle and mobilizing the party for the campaign. Socialists will not raise the strategy in such a national key and the barons and mayors will have great autonomy, but they will demonstrate the policies of the Executive. “There are those who wonder what the progressive government will do in an election year. The answer is simple: the same as in the other years. [...] We will always rule for the majorities, for the middle classes and for the working class, for the people on foot,” Sánchez said on December 30 in a letter to the PSOE militants. The frictions with Emiliano García-Page, the president of Castilla-La Mancha, or Javier Lambán (Aragón) for the penal reforms of sedition and embezzlement, which will benefit the leaders of the proces and other independent cadres awaiting trial, will be parked, and Sanchez will be deployed throughout the territory. Much less clear is the role of Vice President Diaz, who, involved in the preparation of Sumar — which does not happen in May — has already slipped that her presence in the campaign will be limited to those territories where there is unity (as is the case in Barcelona). If confirmed, her strategy would lead her to leave such fundamental territories as Madrid, where in 2021 she supported Pablo Iglesias. Podemos's secretary general, Ione Belarra, has already publicly expressed her desire for Díaz to get involved with the coalition's candidacies, but for now the head of Labor has not picked up the glove. The socialists have suffered as torture the PP's strategy of implanting the image of a PSOE that went from defeat to defeat with the advance of elections in Madrid in 2021 and last year in Castile and Leon and Andalusia. But in 2023 the time will come for the barons: the PSOE will play all its territorial power on May 28. Of the 12 communities that will hold elections, the PP only governs in two: Madrid and Murcia. From the rest, Aragon, Asturias, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Castile-La Mancha, Valencian Community, Extremadura, La Rioja and Navarre have socialist presidents, and in Cantabria the PSOE co-rules with the PRC of Miguel Ángel Revilla. “Our turn comes and we play at home,” says a socialist autonomous president who trusts voters to value his management of the pandemic, as has already happened in favor of the PP in the right-wing governed communities. The PSOE, in any case, does not depend on itself alone: it needs that Podemos does not sink. After years of electoral decline, the minority partner tries to revalidate his presence in the coalition governments of six communities (Navarra, La Rioja, Aragon, Valencian Community, Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands) and to overcome a new setback that weakens his position before the end of the year. Another factor that makes the autonomics a first round of the generals is that Sánchez needs the PSOE to endure in May to consolidate his chances of re-election. The president's tug benefited the barons in the 2019 elections, but now the situation is different. That is why the PP wants the elections to be in national and non-autonomous, to exploit the wear and tear of La Moncloa. “We believe that, with greater or lesser difficulty, we are in a position to win in any of the communities holding elections in 2023,” Feijoo said in the year-end balance sheet. It's another thing to govern. In the PP they hope to achieve a change in the Valencian Community and Aragon, but always depending on the sum with Vox. In Ferraz and La Moncloa, meanwhile, they believe that Feijóo put unnecessary pressure on his face with Sanchez on November 22 in the Senate, when he said that the motion of censure demanded by Vox and Ciudadanos “will be made on May 28, but not in an urn in the Congress of Deputies, but in thousands of ballot boxes in all the municipalities of Spain.” If it doesn't translate into an autonomic turnaround, the PP leader would have a problem. Local elections will serve as a thermometer of the electoral climate throughout Spain. By taking place throughout the country, unlike the autonomics, the parties will interpret their results as a kind of mini-general that will help them test the level of mobilization of their voters. Another very different thing will be the alliances that allow the formation of municipal governments. The PSOE, with 2,700 mayors, defends the cane of command in 22 of the 52 provincial capitals, against a PP that in 2019 went from 21 to 13, although it recovered the jewel of the crown: Madrid. The populars, who also rule in Zaragoza — their ruler, Jorge Azcón, will run for the autonomics— and Malaga, are suffering to find candidates in Barcelona. He tried a broad deal with Ciudadanos, but the Arrimadas party slammed the door. Feijóo deck four candidates, one from outside the PP. The Socialists have it more clearly: they see at hand to achieve the mayor's office of Barcelona taking advantage of the pull of the PSC with Salvador Illa and the policies of Sánchez to bury the procés. Retaining Seville, the main city in socialist hands, is another priority, besides adding to keep Valencia with Compromís. The PSOE's bet for Madrid, Reyes Maroto, is a questioner: the Minister of Industry has barely had a tour of the capital since her candidacy was formalized. Entering the City of Madrid again is one of the goals of Podemos, which will present the exathlete Roberto Sotomayor as the head of the list. But the relationship with More Madrid is not good. Podemos lost most of the so-called change councils in 2019. After the success of 2015, in the next elections only Barcelona (with the commons of Ada Colau) and Cádiz (with the anti-capitalist Kichi, today outside the party) resisted. The territorial implementation has always been the Achilles heel of the formation of Belarra, which finds great difficulties now in Galicia, where the confluence with what remains of the tides is discarded in cities like A Coruña. UI, meanwhile, claims its strength with emblematic mayors such as Zamora or Rivas (Madrid) and the more than 2,000 councillors who have the training throughout Spain. The post-election pacts of May will force Feijóo to make one of the most important decisions as PP leader: whether or not he approves the formation of joint governments with Vox. There is already an autonomous one, in Castile and León, from which Feijóo tried to disassociate himself because his formation took place when he was taking over the party, but the May agreements will be made totally under the umbrella of his leadership. The popular president always eludes the answer to that question, while presenting the PP as a “transversal and labelless” project. However, he is aware that seizing power from the PSOE in some territory will have to happen predictably by agreeing with the ultras. The PP candidates will also, and will press for hands-free. The May elections will measure the resistance capacity of the parties to the left of the PSOE and the unity of its political space, even without having the new brand of Yolanda Díaz. The fear, moreover, is that a hypothetical loss of representation in that election date will influence the generals' negotiations. After the crisis between Podemos and IU this year, the coalition enters in 2023 with the majority of confluences to be realized. The last agreement was that of Madrid for City and Community (where the risk of staying out in case of going apart was real), and before there was one in Navarra and La Rioja. The joint list is taken for granted in the Balearic Islands or Extremadura, but it is complicated in communities like Aragon or Asturias, where there has never been unity. Sources of Podemos call for “fair agreements” and believe that they want to sit at the table with other parties with little implementation clouding the negotiations. Another scenario that has been complicated is the Canary Islands, with the emergence of Proyecto Drago, the new platform led by Alberto Rodríguez. Those of Belarra have already ruled out that their ex-number three, now faced with the state leadership, can lead a candidacy with a space, they say, that “comes practically out of nowhere.” The former MP, however, is very popular on the islands, and formations like IU recognize him as a referent. The president of the Community of Madrid resubmits to the polls just two years after razing up more seats (65 out of 136) than the whole left put together, but forced to achieve her investiture with Vox's votes, which has knocked over her last Budgets. Isabel Díaz Ayuso seeks not to depend now on the extreme right. It has it more difficult than in 2021, as they recognize in their surroundings, because Pablo Iglesias does not present himself for Unión Podemos and because now they will also be held municipal at the same time: the PSOE has an important municipal power in Madrid — it governs 60 of the 179 localities of the region, including eight of the ten major cities. In addition, Ayuso ended the year by fitting his first big blow with the massive demonstration against the deterioration of public health. The primary health-care strike, paralysed until 11 January, remains on its feet.","Spain's political parties are preparing for an electoral year of vertigo in the face of dogs, foreseen as a very long campaign that will culminate in the general elections, in principle scheduled for December.",NEU,0.8597004413604736
