01-09-2023,"Lula convoca a los máximos responsables del Estado tras el asalto de los bolsonaristas al Congreso de Brasil 
","The governor of the Federal District, responsible for the Military Police, who did not cut the extremists off, was dismissed. The President meets with the heads of the legislative and judicial power, with the Minister of Defense and the governors The highest authorities of the Republic of Brazil have been called urgently by the new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, this Monday, a day after a baganarist mob stormed the three powers in the capital, Brasilia. The 77-year-old president plans to meet with the president of the Supreme Court, Rosa Weber, at the presidential palace in Planalto from 9 a.m. local time (1:00 p.m. in Peninsular Spain). He will also hold a meeting with the presidents of Congress, Arthur Lira; and the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco. Others summoned by the president are the Minister of Defense, José Múcio, and the newly appointed chiefs of the Armed Forces. Lira is an ally of former President Jair Bolsonaro and joined in the unanimous condemnation of the assault of the top representatives of the institutions; the second, the president of the Senate, the attack caught him enjoying the New Year's vacation in France. In addition, the governor of the Federal District (DF), Ibaneis Rocha, has been removed from office for failing to prevent the passage of extremists who raided the headquarters of the three branches of the state. In the afternoon, Lula plans to meet with the governors of the 26 states after having telephoned with Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa according to his official agenda. Lula faces on the ninth day of his new mandate the most serious challenge suffered by Brazilian democracy since the end of the dictatorship in 1985. It is the culmination of months of tension, fueled by former ultra-right President Bolsonaro, who is in Florida, United States, and reflects the extreme polarization that divides Brazil into two halves. The Bolanarists, dressed in the colors of the country's flag (yellow and green), emulated the Trumpists to star in a tropical version of the assault on the Washington Capitol two years ago, with the difference that in Brasilia the institutions were not gathered in session, that there were no deaths and that it was no surprise, but an attack feared by the Democrats for months. In the case of Brazil, three hours later the security forces had regained control of the three buildings. Thousands of baganarists whom the former president has convinced that they were robbed of the elections held last October invaded Congress, the Presidency and the Supreme Court, located around the square of the Three Powers designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The defeated president lukewarmly condemned the attack by the most radical sections of his followers, who for months have been encouraged to distrust the voting system, the counting system and the highest court of justice. When the takeover of political power headquarters was still underway, Lula accused his predecessor of instigating the “fascist vandals.” The assailants destroyed furniture and works of art, broke pieces of the glazed facades and flooded Congress before being evicted by the police. They are very valuable pieces, part of the modernist heritage designed by Niemeyer when, together with the urbanist Lucio Costa, he devised Brasilia, inaugurated in the center of the country in 1961. One of the reasons for moving the capital of Rio de Janeiro to the interior was to make it difficult for hypothetical protests against the authorities, in addition to shielding them from a possible attack such as the one perpetrated on Sunday. The assault took place in the same place where a week before a festive crowd of 300,000 gathered Lula, along with dozens of foreign heads of state, on his return to power for a third term. On Monday morning, the police evicted the coup camp set up in front of the Army headquarters in Brasilia. Between 1,200 and 1,400 people were held for identification, according to Army spokesman Marcos Andrpe Benzecry. The baganarists were not arrested, but taken to a place where they are being identified and reviewed. “That’s where the investigation begins to see if they have anything to do with Sunday’s vandalism,” Benzecry said. A Supreme Court judge ordered the dismantling of all camps erected two months ago, after the elections, by radical Bolsonaroists who question the official result that gave Lula the victory, for the minimum, against Bolsonaro (51% versus 49%). A few days ago, the new defense minister estimated that there were about 5,000 people in the protests scattered across the country. The decision is signed by Judge Alexandre de Moraes, the most active of the magistrates of the highest court, who also ordered the suspension for 90 days of the governor of the DF, Ibaneis Rocha, an ally of Bolsonaro who was aware of the march towards the institutions and was the maximum responsible of the Military Police of the DF, who did not cut the way to the extremists. The governor now dismissed apologized to Lula on Sunday after he removed the secretary of security, a former Bolsonaro police minister who is on vacation in Florida, where the former president and ultra-right leader is also located. Bolsonaro traveled to Orlando two days before the end of his term of office so as not to replace his nemesis, Lula. As soon as the new president was sworn in, Bolsonaro lost presidential immunity and can therefore be formally prosecuted in any of the multiple investigations opened against him. The assault was still under way when Lula, in his capacity as head of state, ordered federal public security intervention in the DF, i.e., that the federal government assume command of the security forces that until then were under the control of the governor. “This genocidal is feeding this [the attack] via [social] networks from Miami,” the chief executive said at an improvised press conference. A good part of the invaders reached the political heart of Brazil in a hundred buses and walked quietly, escorted even by the Military Police, from the coup camp installed in the headquarters of the Army Headquarters, another spectacular building in Niemeyer located nine kilometers from the buildings assaulted. The security forces arrested some 300 people accused of participating in the invasion, which the Brazilian press already defines as “terrorists”, an unusual term at the domestic level in this country until Christmas Eve the police arrested a baganarist accused of a failed bombing. Throughout Monday, some 1,200 people had been held for identification.

01-09-2023,"Bolsonaro, desde Florida, condena de forma tibia el asalto: “Las invasiones escapan a la regla”
","The former president, who traveled to the United States in December not to transfer power to Lula, disassociates himself from the events in Brasilia While his supporters stormed Congress, the Government Palace and the Supreme Court in Brasilia, Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has waited several hours before taking a decision. He has done so through several tweets, from Orlando, Florida, where he finds himself: “Peaceful demonstrations, according to the law, are part of democracy. However, the predations and invasions of public buildings such as those that occurred today, as well as those practiced by the left in 2013 and 2017, escape the rule,” said the ultra-rightist, who refers to the popular protests in the final stretch of Dilma Rousseff’s government and after his dismissal, when some protesters walked on the roof of Congress. His first messages have arrived about five hours after the assault began and when law enforcement had regained control of the situation. “Throughout my term of office, I have always been within the four lines of the Constitution respecting and defending the laws, democracy, transparency and our sacred freedom,” he wrote in a second tweet. “In addition, he repudiates the accusations, without proof, attributed to me by the current head of the executive power of Brazil,” he added in a third, which closes the thread, and with which he comes to pass the words of the president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has held him responsible for the assault. In the last week, images of the ex-mandatario greeted his followers and also a photograph of him eating fried chicken at a KFC restaurant in Orlando, Florida, where he travelled on December 30 without giving much explanation. Bolsonaro arrived at Orlando's Signature Flight Support airport aboard the presidential plane and was taken, escorted by his security service, to a mansion of Brazilian mixed martial arts fighter José Aldo da Silva, where he has been staying. With his trip to the United States in the last days of his presidency, Bolsonaro avoided the drink of imposing the presidential gang and making the solemn transfer of power to his successor and rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro is subject to several investigations into his management, so it has been speculated that his departure from the country seeks to avoid them. The former president refused to expressly acknowledge Lula's victory in the second round of the Brazilian presidential elections just over two months ago. After doubting the clean-up of the process before election day, he remained silent after October 30, when he fell defeated. He broke that silence to ask his followers dissatisfied with the election result to clear the roads they kept blocked, then to warn that the Armed Forces were “the last obstacle to terrorism” and, finally, before leaving for the United States, he said goodbye in tears with a message from the Palace of Alvorada. Prior to this Sunday’s assault, Bolsonaro condemned the violent acts, but at the same time called his disgruntled followers “patriots,” the same adjective that former U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly used to refer to those who assaulted the Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021. In recent days, he has written different messages on both Twitter and Telegram to gloss over the supposed achievements of his mandate. For example, the revaluation of the Brazilian real against the dollar in 2022 or the increase in infrastructure investments. Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez linked this Sunday the assault in Brasilia to the one that occurred in the United States two years ago, when supporters of then President Donald Trump broke into the Capitol of Washington. “Almost two years after the day the U.S. Capitol was attacked by fascists, we see fascist movements abroad trying to do the same in Brazil. We must stand in solidarity with Lula's democratically elected government. The United States must stop granting refuge to Bolsonaro in Florida,” he wrote on his Twitter account. Actually, Bolsonaro has no refugee status in the United States.","The former president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, rejects the accusations made by the president of Brazil, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who has held him responsible for the assault on Congress.",NEG,0.80632483959198
01-09-2023,"Un millar de personas son desalojadas del campamento bolsonarista para ser identificadas tras el asalto al Congreso de Brasil
","A judge of the Supreme Court removed for 90 days the governor of the Federal District (DF) of Brasilia, Ibaneis Rocha, for not having prevented the assault of the mob Between 1,200 and 1,400 people have voluntarily retired from the Bolanarist camp erected months ago in front of the Army Headquarters in Brasilia, according to Colonel Benzecry. They have been removed and held in other areas to be identified. With this, the police seek to be responsible for this Sunday's assault on the headquarters of the three branches of the state in Brazil (Congress, Presidency and Supreme Court). The area, where supporters of the former ultra-right president had been camped since October in protest of Lula's victory at the polls, which they do not recognize, dawned in the midst of tense calm. There was some movement, small corrillos in which the events of the day were discussed and the next steps were discussed. After hours of maximum tension in the capital of the South American country, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre Moraes ordered the State security forces to release any street, avenue or public building occupied by the Bolanarists, including these camps. In addition, Moraes decided last night to remove the governor of the Federal District (DF) of Brasilia, Ibaneis Rocha, for 90 days, for not having been able to prevent the assault of the mob. Some 1,200 people are already being held for identification, according to the civilian police. In the camp it was hard to disguise the fear for what might happen to them in the next few hours. Just in case, in order not to be seen, some left the tangle of tents and awnings across the field, avoiding staying on the main avenue of access, now blocked and guarded. The area where the Bolsanarist camp is located is huge and is surrounded (like almost everything in Brasilia) by extensive meadows dotted with trees. At night it's easy to walk without a trace. Some complained that on Sunday afternoon there was a helicopter flying over for hours and pretended that although the police tried to access the compound, the military maneuvered to prevent it. Despite the hard-handed promises of the authorities against the coup protestors, the atmosphere at the end of Sunday was similar to that of last weeks: dozens of tents, banners asking the Armed Forces for “succor” to prevent the “return of communism” to Brazil and some lady praying on her knees for the good of the homeland. The novelty of the day was that, in addition to the usual campers, each one with his sleeping bag and his personal belongings, at night some newcomers joined themselves as they could to the weather: baganarists who had participated in the invasion in the afternoon and who came here to feel that they were in a safe place. More than a thousand have left, and the rest now have the hours counted. “Here we are in a safe area, in front of the army headquarters, they [the military] will not betray us,” said, hours before the eviction, a very safe woman of about 60 years who did not want to identify herself. Among the Bolanarists he was already whispering last night about the possibility that at dawn the military police would break into the camp and order it to be disassembled in a hurry and violent manner. “We are many more than the police. What jail will they put so many people in? Are they going to fill a prison of patriot Brazilians?” insisted the woman, who boasted that she had been camping for 67 days. Finally, many people have left this Monday voluntarily without violence or altercation. And after five hours of assault, Sunday night brought some calm to Brasilia. After midnight, the Plaza de los Tres Poderidades, where the three buildings attacked are concentrated, was absolutely armored by the police forces. The blockades began almost two kilometers around, so approaching the destruction was impossible task. In the gigantic Esplanade of the Ministries, where thousands of baganarists marched smoothly towards their goal, there was no sight of a soul and silence reigned. This imposing avenue was also cut off, both to the vehicles and pedestrians, and the only sign that something serious had happened was the reddish reflection of the lights of the police cars standing on the access streets to the zero area of the assault. The camp is, in a way, the embryo of what happened on Sunday afternoon. A large part of the demonstrators who raided the headquarters of the three branches of the state walked around peacefully on foot eight kilometres in a straight line, escorted by the police. But now, after months of tolerance on the part of the local authorities, the Bolanarist camp has the hours told. The judge of the Supreme Alexandre de Moraes ordered it to be dismantled immediately. He determined that the operation will be led by the Military Police of the Federal District, with the support, if necessary, of the National Force and the Federal Police, and in addition, the military commander of the army headquarters will have to provide all necessary assistance. “Absolutely nothing justifies the existence of camps full of terrorists, sponsored by various financiers and with the complacency of civil and military authorities,” the judge criticized. On vandalism, which ended with offices, furniture, historical objects and works of art from the country’s most important public buildings destroyed, these far-right supporters already have the narrative ready: “Those who have done that are infiltrated by the left. We are peaceful,” the campers insisted, always refusing to identify themselves publicly. Between 1,200 and 1,400 people have voluntarily withdrawn from the Bolanarist camp erected months ago in front of the Army Headquarters, according to Colonel Benzecry, and have been removed and held in other areas for identification. With this, the police seek responsibility for yesterday's assault on the headquarters of the three state powers in Brazil.

01-09-2023,"La crisis institucional beneficia al PP, que amplía su ventaja sobre el PSOE 
","Socialists drag the demobilization of their electorate and 7.9% of their 2019 voters now opt for Feijóo The institutional crisis with which the year 2022 ended, with accusations of coupry included, seems to pass more bill to the government than to the opposition. In the month in which the Constitutional Court interfered for the first time in a legislative process to annul the procedure of the rule intended to overcome the blockade in the replacement of four of its judges; when the reduction of the penalty for crimes of personal embezzlement was approved, the crime of sedition was abrogated and - even more - the political crisis was triggered, the popular people rose in estimate of vote and the PSOE resented, according to the barometer of January 40dB. for the Country and the Chain BEING. Interviews (2,000) took place between 27 and 31 December. All internal data from the survey can be found on the country's websites and the SER chain. The socialists leave almost nine tenths of expectation of voting over the previous barometer and the PP's advantage is already two points over the PSOE. In seats, the pro-popular distance goes from eight to 13 MPs by losing the socialists three - and staying at 109 - and winning PP two - until 122. The sum of the parties that favored (with their vote in favour or abstention) the investiture of Pedro Sánchez in January 2020 is, for the moment, higher than that of the right-wing bloc, but the opposition seems to have won the battle of the story in the monumental brawl generated by the lack of renewal of the judicial organs that the headlines of last December seized. The PP of Alberto Núñez Feijóo obtains, 11 months from the generals, planned for next December, 28.9% in the estimate of vote, that is 7.9 points more than in the elections of November 2019 with Pablo Casado candidate. The popular take the bulk of the booty (34.7%) of the former voters of Ciudadanos and 9.5% of those of Vox. They also have the most faithful voter: 80.9% of those who chose their ballot in 2019 would do so again. Since the last generals, in which they obtained their worst election result (89 deputies), the PP would have increased 33 seats, according to the barometer. Meanwhile, Santiago Abascal's party, which resented the self-generated expectations in the Andalusian elections and the internal crisis caused by the departure of its candidate, Macarena Olona, stabilizes and would obtain today results very similar to those of the previous barometer, with 14% of the estimate of vote, although far from the results of the 2019 generals: they would pass from 52 to 41 seats. The ultra party loses more than three loyalty points this month (77.8% would repeat), although it captures older PP voters (10.5%) than in the previous barometer. Citizens continue between life and political death. The percentage of former voters who now prefer the PP (34.7%) is higher than that of the last faithful (30.6%). The transfers also consolidate the brand in the right-wing bloc — 6.5% of its former voters would now opt for Vox — despite old alliances with the PSOE. In the left bloc, socialists are dragging a double problem of fidelity and mobilization. Only 66.5% of its 2019 voters would repeat; 13.3% are indecisive and 7.2% — two points more than a month ago — now prefers the PP ballot. That percentage is residual in reverse: only 0.3% of those who voted for the popular in the past generals would now choose the PSOE. It was precisely to this problem, that of the scant mobilization of its electorate, that socialists blamed their great electoral stick last year: the loss of one of their traditional fiefdoms, Andalusia, a community where they ruled for almost 40 years, now in the hands of the popular Juan Manuel Moreno Bonilla, who rules with an absolute majority. The government partner, Unión Podemos, with an estimate of 11.5% of the vote, today would obtain 31 seats, one more than in the previous barometer and four less than in the 2019 elections. The formation manages to improve its fidelity - 69.3% would repeat vote - and reduces the leaks towards the PSOE by three points (9.7%). More Country remains at levels very similar to those of the previous barometer (3.6%) and would obtain four seats, one more than in the previous general seats. Among those who opted for abstention in the 2019 elections, 36.7% would again ignore the polls, 24.2% have not yet decided what to do, 13.5% would now vote for the PP, 9.2% for the PSOE and 6.3% for Vox. ERC, PNV and Bildu would repeat the 2019 result with 13, 6 and 5 seats respectively. JXC would win one, up to 9 deputies. The BNG would go from one to two. Only 56.2% say they will vote safely in the upcoming elections. This percentage rises to 74.3% in the case of PP voters in 2019, followed by those of Unidas Podemos (72.6%). The voter of the party that presides over the government, the PSOE, seems the most disenchanted and demobilized (just 64.3% are convinced to go to vote) only behind that of Ciudadanos, who plays survival and does not even have a clear candidate.","The PP of Alberto Nez Feijo obtains, 11 months from the generals, 28.9% in the estimate of vote, that is 7.9 points more than in the elections of November 2019 with Pablo Casado candidate.

01-09-2023,"La mayoría pagaría más impuestos para mejorar la sanidad 
","Private insurance is more popular in Catalonia and the Community of Madrid Citizens' and health workers' protests due to lack of resources have revived the debate on public health management in Spain. The last barometer of 40 dB. for EL COUNTRY and SER, with 2,000 interviews conducted last December, addressed the quality of medical services in the different communities five months after the regional elections. 64.5% think that in the autonomy in which they live, “too few resources” are allocated for public health. 39.1% see its functioning “regulating”, although the percentage of those who rate it as good or very good (32.7%) exceeds that of those who rate it as bad or very bad (26.8%). And those who are willing to pay more taxes to improve those services earn those who are not. All internal data from the survey can be found on the country's websites and the SER chain. On a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being the pole of the most convinced that “it is important to improve public health even if that involves paying more taxes” and 10 the extreme of those who think that the important thing is to “pay less taxes even if that means reducing the quality of public health”, the average on the general population is 3.2. Only 2.6% of Spaniards are in the “anti-tax” pole, with many more who prefer to invest in the welfare state: 61.0% are between 0 and 4 of the pole in favor of the increase in taxes and the majority group (23.1%) is 0. By region, of the four most populated, the Community of Madrid is the one that presents a more determined citizenship to a broad taxation that finances a good health, followed by Catalonia, the Valencian Community and Andalusia. The voters most willing to pay the most are, by this order, the United Podemos, the nationalist or regionalist parties and the PSOE. And the least of them, Vox, PP and Citizens. Health assessment varies according to the governing party of each autonomous community. Thus, residents in self-governments presided over by socialists (Aragón, Asturias, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Castilla-La Mancha, Valencian Community, Extremadura, Navarra and La Rioja) are more satisfied with the functioning of public health (34.8% value it positively compared to 23.5% that does so in a negative way) than those living in communities governed by the PP (Andalusia, Castile and Leon, Galicia, Community of Madrid and Region of Murcia) or by nationalist or regionalist parties (Catalonia, Basque Country and Cantabria). In the communities presided over by the PSOE, satisfaction seems more widespread among voters of different formations. The positive assessment of PP is 10.4 points higher than the negative. Only in Vox's electorate do critics have a major advantage of 25.9 points. In the autonomy governed by the PP, however, opinions are much more polarized. For example, the Community of Madrid has, among the most populated, the highest percentage of positive (38.1%) and negative (30.6%) opinions on the functioning of its health care and health service, which, compared to the Spanish average, generates many more very good ratings (12.8% compared to 6.6%) and very bad (17.1% compared to 12.6%). The best net balance is for the Valencian Community (36.1% positive compared to 25.1% negative). Andalusia and Catalonia get worse grades than the Spanish average in terms of public health services. Respondents readily approve of medical facilities (74.7%), the possibility of face-to-face care (66.9%) and the time of care (61.6%), but only 42.6% say they have often managed to get a quick appointment in the past year. This delay seems widespread, although it is in the communities governed by nationalist or regionalist parties that more citizens claim to have received good service. Of the four most populated autonomies, Catalonia is the one with the least delay in appointments; Madrid the highest frequency of face-to-face care when required and the Valencian Community the region in which doctors most often devote sufficient time to consultations. Eighty-eight per cent claim to be a user of the public health system. Private insurance is particularly popular in Catalonia (26.4% versus 15.7% common in Spain) and the Community of Madrid (21.9%). 11.9% of Spaniards claim to have participated in a protest related to the health services they receive in the past year and 27.1% have planned to do so. The participation rate in public health actions is somewhat higher in the communities governed by the PP (13 per cent) than in those with a socialist (11.4 per cent) or nationalist (10.3 per cent) executive and much higher among the voters of the United Nations Podemos (22.5 per cent) and the PSOE (14.8 per cent) than among the electorate of Vox (8.8 per cent), Ciudadanos (7.6 per cent) or the PP (6.3 per cent). The Autonomous Communities have budgeted an average health expenditure for 2023 of 1,808,5 euros per inhabitant. This 7.7% increase falls below the average increase in the CPI. Madrid is in line, with a budget of 1,446.13 euros per citizen, although the increase in spending (11.2%) exceeds the average, according to the recent report of the Federation of Associations in Defense of Public Health. The Principality of Asturias (€2,133 per capita) and the Basque Country (€2,130) are in the lead.","More than half of Spaniards think that in the autonomy in which they live, “too few resources” are allocated for public health.",NEG,0.6463578343391418
01-09-2023,"Trevijano reivindica la intervención en las Cortes en su discurso de despedida como presidente del Constitucional
","The progressive majority of the guarantee court begins its new phase with the inauguration of the new judges In his farewell speech, the outgoing president of the Constitutional Court, Pedro Gónzález-Trevijano, defended Monday the intervention in the Courts held at the end of December to stop the vote on its reform. Trevijano recalled during his presentation that “the Court was conceived by the constituent as a body guaranteeing the Constitution”. It has continued: “Its regulation in Title IX of the Basic Standard takes it away, even systematically, from the three classical powers (legislative, executive and judicial), referred to in Titles III to VI, and places it, together with the power to reform the Constitution of Title X, as a guarantee of respect for the will of the constituent power vis-à-vis the constituted powers. That is why it is entrusted with the control of respect for the Constitution by those other three powers, including the legislature. Obviously, the control over the constitutionality of laws cannot be carried out ‘without recognizing and respecting the very wide margin of configuration that belongs to the legislator in order to give effect to his political choices.” The four new Constitutional judges took office this Monday in an event held at the seat of the court. Juan Carlos Campo and Laura Díez, appointed by the Government, and María Luisa Segoviano and César Tolosa, elected by the General Council of the Judiciary, already occupy the four seats that correspond to them following the agreement reached between progressive and conservative members of the governing body of the judges, which allowed to unblock the renewal of the court of guarantees. Trevijano has also asked during his speech not to use the Constitutional in the political fray and to fill the vacancy of Judge Alfredo Montoya “as soon as possible”. Trevijano’s intervention, in which reference is made to the serious institutional crisis among the State’s powers last December, in which the Constitutional stopped in the Senate the vote on a reform promoted by the Government for the renewal of the guarantee court itself, has an impact on the supremacy of the Constitution against “parliamentary sovereignty”. “Before the Magna Carta are not opposable popular sovereigntys that claim to emanate, without any intermediation, from the supposed direct mandate of a collective or a collective. In Spain there is only one sovereignty, national sovereignty, that of the Spanish people, solemnly expressed on December 6, 1978, with the approval of the Constitution”, the judge said. “Before the Spanish people “there is no room (...) for parallel parliamentary sovereignty, without prejudice to recognizing the political primacy of the Cortes Generales,” he added. “Citizens and public authorities must realize that their appeal [to the Constitutional] is only to take place after exhausting all avenues of resolution, not as an instrument of political strife or of indefinite judicial bodies,” Trevijano said in his farewell speech. It was the PP that appealed to the Court of Guarantees to try to curb the Government's initiative. “Let us stress that the Constitutional Court does not constitute a third chamber, nor a fourth instance, nor a sort of supercasation,” he added. Moreover, it has had an impact, without mentioning specific cases, that “sometimes” there are “unjustified cascading challenges (...) with the crude aim of hindering its functioning and undermining its credibility, if not fraudulently altering its composition”. PSOE and Unidas Podemos asked in December for the challenge – whose term has expired since last June and which were appointed on the proposal of Mariano Rajoy's Executive – claiming that they could not decide on the legal reform that the Executive was pushing because they had personal interests in that decision. González-Trevijano highlighted the importance of “compliance with deadlines” and “procedures” for the renewal of the court of guarantees, in addition to the “due choice” of the “best and most suitable” if one does not want to fall, as President Emeritus Cruz Villalón pointed out, “in irrelevance”. Trevijano also recalled that, despite the renewal, the Constitutional Court remains incomplete and has asked the political parties to fill the vacancy of Judge Alfredo Montoya “as soon as possible”. In another moment of his speech, of about 50 minutes, González-Trevijano has attacked the classifications of the magistrates according to their ideology or those who have proposed them. “I do not share the false dichotomy between conservative and progressive judges (...) a magistrate does not represent anyone, he is alone with his conscience and depends only on it,” he said. The new members of the court replace the current president, Pedro González-Trevijano and Judge Antonio Narváez, appointed by the Government of Mariano Rajoy (PP), and the Vice President of the Constitutional, Juan Antonio Xiol, and Judge Santiago Martínez Vares, appointed by the Judiciary. Xiol is the only progressive of the four. With the renewal, the previous internal equilibrium is reversed, as three progressives and one conservative enter with this renewal. Following the act of inauguration, a short transitional period is now opened in which the presidency of the Constitutional Court becomes occupied by the judge of the conservative sector Ricardo Enríquez, because he is the oldest. As interim president, it is up to Enriquez to convene the plenary session as soon as possible, in which the current eleven members of the court will have to decide who will be the president and vice-president of the Constitutional. The twelfth seat, corresponding to the judge of the conservative sector Alfredo Montoya, who resigned last July for health reasons, is currently not covered. The seven judges who will now make up the progressive majority of the court will hold a first meeting on Tuesday afternoon to explore the possibility that there will finally be a single candidacy from this sector. Two of the members of this new majority, Cándido Conde-Pumpido and María Luisa Balaguer, have expressed their desire to accede to the presidency. The intention of the other five components of the progressive bloc is to listen to their approaches and projects before deciding on their support for one or another candidacy, if they both maintain their aspirations. The plenary session to elect president will be expected on Wednesday at 1 p.m., as progressive judges have asked for a little more time to try to reach an agreement. A priori, the decisive vote may be that of Judge María Luisa Segoviano, who joined the court after having left the Supreme upon retirement, having been the first woman to accede to the presidency of one of its five chambers, the Social, in charge of labour law. Segoviano has introduced the gender perspective into the doctrine of this chamber, a work that María Luisa Balaguer has also been carrying out in the Constitutional through her draft sentences and her particular votes, when her theses have remained a minority in the court. The intention of the members of the progressive group is, in any case, to try to find formulas that avoid the image of division in the first vote, regarding who holds the position of president. To achieve the presidency, Balaguer would need to get at least another vote from his own bloc, the progressive, in order to add it to those of the four judges who make up the conservative sector of the Constitutional, which from now on becomes the minority of the court. In this way Balaguer's candidacy would add 6 votes and Count-Pumpido's 5. This afternoon's meeting will be decisive in resolving whether the internal pact between the progressives is appropriate in order to avoid the fracture between its components. In any case, the vote to elect the new leadership of the court will not take place until tomorrow Tuesday, in a specific plenary session that will give way to the beginning of the new stage of the Constitutional.","The outgoing president of the Constitutional Court, Pedro Gnzlez-Trevijano, defended Monday the intervention in the Courts held at the end of December to stop the vote on its reform.",NEU,0.9474455714225769

","The Hearing will predictably decide that the former Andalusian president will be treated for now the disease in freedom The forensic doctor has recommended to the Audiencia de Sevilla that the former Andalusian president José Antonio Griñán remain free to treat the prostate cancer he suffers. “After the personal interview and in the light of the clinical information provided, it can be concluded that it is not advisable to enter the prison until the referral of his cancer pathology by the services of urology and radiotherapy oncology is confirmed,” considers the doctor who examined Griñán, convicted by the Supreme Court in the political piece of the ERE case. After the interview with the audience last week, the coroner argues that the possible side effects on hormone treatment and radiation therapy that the former Andalusian president will receive, in addition to the “frequent revisions” to which he will be subjected, seem “uncompatible” with “prison dynamics”. This despite the fact that Griñán has not yet begun treatment and prison health care “can cope with any medical demand,” highlights the optional. In this way, the Audiencia, after seeking the opinion of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the PP as accusations, allows Griñán to treat cancer from his home instead of prison. So far, six of the eight convicted of embezzlement have entered the political piece of the ERE case, and the final resolution of the Hearing is awaiting the former president and former vice councillor Agustín Barberá, who is also suffering from a serious illness and who is awaiting the opinion of the coroner. The doctor warns that Griñán’s disease, diagnosed last December, is “very serious” and the diagnosis of a cancer produces a “fall of its psychic structure” and a “great uncertainty regarding treatment and evolution.” Imprisonment “does not help to cope” with this disease, which needs “family and social support, necessary and even essential” in these cases. In addition, he emphasizes that “we do not know” the evolution of the disease and possible side effects following the taking of medication and radiation therapy to which the former president is subjected, so this medical report is “a predictive analysis” regarding the effect that the prison would have on the former president.",A forensic doctor has recommended to the Audiencia de Sevilla that the former Andalusian president José Antonio Grin remain free to treat the prostate cancer he suffers.

01-09-2023,"Feijóo recupera a Borja Sémper como portavoz de campaña del PP para las elecciones de mayo
","The president of the main opposition party tries to legitimize the expired term of office of the judiciary by saying that he was elected with “an 80% majority” in 2013 Borja Sémper returns to politics. This was confirmed by the president of the PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, who appeared this Monday at the headquarters of Genoa, following the meeting of the steering committee in which the team of the campaign of the autonomous and municipal elections of May 28 has been confirmed, to present the former Basque parliamentarian as the main spokesman in that campaign. “I thank you for returning to national politics, we ask you that what you have done in Euskadi, do it in the rest of Spain, calling things by name, but avoiding radicality,” explained Feijóo about the PP’s export voice in the Basque Parliament, which returns to politics three years after having abandoned motu proprio. “One day, three years ago, I left because I needed it and because a new opportunity opened up for me and my family. I return for similar reasons, a new opportunity to change things opens up,” Sémper said after listening to the president’s words. “I aspire to contribute to a policy as serene as the citizens it represents. I'm not contributing to any more noise. Feijóo has asked me to contribute more moderation and centrality where others offer insults and disqualifications, with a broad project, without labels,” the spokesman has recapped, who will accompany in the race to the elections to Elias Bendodo, also confirmed this Monday as campaign director by the steering committee. The intention of Genoa is for Sémper to continue as leader of the PP after the meeting at the ballot box in May. The spokesperson has abandoned his work in private enterprise and will dedicate himself exclusively to the party, also as a member of the steering committee, to be aware of decision-making and also to transmit to them the electoral strategy. “We have to normalize and give another air to the exercise of politics,” said Semper, who had been communicating fluidly with Feijóo about the course the PP should take after the arrival of the president last April, with the departure of Pablo Casado. Sémper made the decision to integrate into the organic structure of the popular before the end of the year, but it has not been made public until this Monday. Sources of Genoa consider that his figure responds to Feijóo’s strategy to “eliminate” the “walls” of the left-right political axis in order to encompass broader majorities under “moderation” policies. Feijóo also referred to the elections of 28 May, in which there are 12 autonomous communities at stake and in which the PP aspires to take away most of the places in the PSOE during an interview at COPE early in the morning. That is why he has appealed to those who voted for Ciudadanos and Vox to join under the umbrella of the People's Party to facilitate governments without coalitions and broad majorities. “It would be difficult to rule with Vox. Because legislatures are short and governments are to do things, not to argue. We have a government divided by a left divided by three. The coalitions are bad and if I can avoid them, I will avoid them,” Feijóo has riveted. A position that Sémper has reinforced at a press conference. “I have a personal relationship with Santi Abascal bombproof. But what it represents is not what I expect for my country. We have not come to oppose the opposition.” This Saturday, the party already announced that ñigo de la Serna, former mayor of Santander and former Minister of Development with Rajoy, joined Bendodo's team. The campaign committee, which will meet regularly, will hold its first conclave next Thursday. The socialists aspire to revalidate nine autonomous governments in May with the popular stepping on their heels in three of the territories holding elections, Extremadura, Cantabria and the Valencian Community, while the popular are already preparing their offensive to snatch nine of the 12 contested autonomous executives from them. The institutional crisis with which the year 2022 ended, with accusations of coupry included, seems to pass more bill to the government than to the opposition. According to the January 40dB barometer. For THE COUNTRY and the SER Chain, carried out between December 27 and 31, the populars went up in voting estimate and the PSOE resented losing almost nine tenths of the expectation of voting compared to the previous poll. The PP's advantage is already two points over the PSOE. Next Saturday, Feijóo presents his regional candidates at a big event in Zaragoza. On Monday, the PP again removed the possibility of renewing the mandate of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) in the medium term. The leader of the party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, has legitimized the term of office of the members of the judiciary—expired for more than four years—on the grounds that the judges' names were elected with a high consensus during Mariano Rajoy's first government, when the then president had an absolute majority. “Who has manipulated, intervened and emptied of content the General Council of the Judiciary, which is being extended, with 80% of the support of the legislature where he was elected, is the Government,” Feijóo said at COPE as well. This Monday, Feijóo has not even referred to when he could sit back with the government to negotiate the new judiciary, and has referred to the bill filed by the PP in Congress on December 30. In this text they ask, among other issues, that it be the judges themselves who appoint the 12 judges of judicial extraction and remove this power from the Courts. That's his condition now.

01-09-2023,"España pedirá a Bruselas prolongar la excepción ibérica al menos hasta final de 2024
","The government will discuss Tuesday its reform proposal for the whole European electricity market The government wants to maintain the gas price cap, which came into force in June to lower the electricity bill, at least until the end of 2024. Third Vice President and Minister of Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera has advanced this Monday that the Executive will ask the European Commission to extend the so-called Iberian exception – it applies in Spain and Portugal – beyond the agreed deadline (31 May), especially while the war in Ukraine lasts and the EU negotiates fundamental changes in the European electricity system to reduce price volatility. The Council of Ministers intends to discuss this Tuesday the reform proposal that Spain will send to Brussels. The Iberian exception is one of the formulas that Spain defends to reduce the impact on the electricity bill of the historic escalation of the gas and, according to the calculations of the government, has allowed since its application a saving of 4 billion euros to the consumers. Its objective is to maintain this system, as Ribera has advanced in declarations to Antena 3, with a price cap similar to the current one: “We would like it to remain as similar as it is today, as low as possible, in the environment of 45 or 50 per MWh, and that can be extended at least until the end of 2024.” The mechanism currently sets a limit on the price of gas used for electricity production of 40 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) and applies increases of 5 euros per month until the end of 70 euros. From 1 January the limit price is 45 euros. Although Brussels initially rejected this mechanism, it is also now preparing to push forward similar measures across the EU: in December it agreed to introduce a cap on gas across the continent as of 15 February, but the limit is 180 euros per MWh, higher than that in force on the Iberian peninsula, and will only be activated when the price exceeds that maximum for three days in a row and the difference from the global market exceeds 35 euros. Ribera stressed the need to change the electricity system across the EU to reduce and lower the volatility in electricity prices. In Spain, he pointed out, it has been achieved in part with some of the measures adopted, such as tax rebates and the Iberian exception. To top the gas has served to shield its impact on the formation of the price of electricity. In European wholesale markets, a marginalist system prevails, making the price of the last kWh necessary to match supply and demand decide the price of 100% of energy. In this way, when high-cost technology, such as gas, is to be used, the impact is transferred to all the energy negotiated for that hour. The Iberian exception, on the one hand, encounters this price of gas to prevent it from infecting the entire price and, on the other, compensates gas producers for the difference, a cost that is transferred to the receipt of the light. The EU is looking at a new regulation that will bring more stability to the energy market after an extremely convulsive year of 2022. The government plans to analyze its proposal this Tuesday, before sending it to Brussels, to develop an energy autonomy to give more stability to a market that the Russian invasion of Ukraine blew up. This was highlighted by Pedro Sánchez during his speech this Monday at the Conference of Ambassadors, according to Europa Press. The aim is to promote the deployment of renewable energies and to seek an equitable distribution of income between consumers and energy producers in a situation of “tension and crisis” like the current one. “With this proposal to reform the electricity market at European level, Spain is exporting constructive solutions such as the Iberian solution and how this reform of the electricity market should be,” he said. Sánchez has also advanced that the government will approve a royal decree on Tuesday to regulate participation in the first four of the eleven renewable green hydrogen projects approved by the European Union and which include grants of 74 million euros from European funds. The evolution of electricity prices has been favored in autumn and the beginning of winter by the mild temperatures recorded in Spain. In this regard, Ribera has pointed out that gas warehouses are full in the vast majority of the European territory or around 85% or 90%. In this way, he stressed that Europe faces this second half of winter and the beginning of spring “in very good condition”, and that it must prepare for what may happen next autumn. The “bottom-up solution”, according to the minister, is to reduce European dependence on gas as quickly as possible, betting on the transformation of the energy system and on more own resources and renewable energies. Despite all the measures put in place, electricity and gas receipts increased by more than 30 per cent last year. In the wholesale market, where in March 2022 a record 545 euros per megawatt hour was reached in Spain, the price will be set tomorrow at 112 euros, a level more similar to that of 2021. It is expected that the year will go from less to more: the derivatives market points to a first and second quarters of relatively low prices and a second half clearly upwards. The Government's decision to maintain the full tax reduction applied in recent months will contribute to this trend — albeit at the expense of a tax bill that continues to grow. The VAT on light will remain at 5%, after two drops (from 21%) in the last year and a half. The generation tax (7%) will remain on hold, while the special rate will remain at 0.5%, the minimum allowed by the European Commission, compared to 5.11% before the crisis.","The government will ask the European Commission to extend the so-called Iberian exception, which applies in Spain and Portugal, beyond the agreed deadline (31 May), especially while the war in Ukraine lasts and the EU negotiates fundamental changes in the European electricity system to reduce price volatility.

01-09-2023,"El jefe de los mercenarios rusos rompe la ley del silencio del Kremlin
","Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman at the head of the Wagner group, takes advantage of his political and media projection to break a taboo with Putin: criticism and threats in public against other members of the Russian elite There was a time when the Russian elite was washing their dirty rags at home. Those who openly criticized their rivals saw how their political careers ended suddenly in order from above. Vladimir Putin was the guarantor of stability, and tensions between the various factions that fluttered around the president were a matter that was resolved behind closed doors. In addition, the Kremlin was concerned about preserving appearances by giving a legal envelope to all its actions, even the most repressive. At least it was until the war. Inflamed by his role in the offensive against Ukraine, one of Putin's businessmen, the owner of the Wagner mercenary company, Yevgeny Prigozhin (Leningrad, 61), has dared to test the status quo with threats and accusations of public treason against other senior officials. The real power of Prigozhin is often exaggerated, also founder of the trolls and bots factory that carried propaganda and destabilization against the West through social networks. The one known as Putin's chef for his catering company, has two armies, one military and one media, but has not succeeded in four years in overthrowing a relatively low-weight politician such as the governor of St.Petersburg, his archprival Alexánder Beglov. Despite supporting him in his election in 2019, the businessman has seen how the politician rejected the construction of several of his projects, and the confrontation ended when Prigozhin had his hands free thanks to the dependence of the Russian armed forces on his mercenaries. “Beglov does not bring any benefit to the city, he has created a system to divide the money, buildings and territories of the city among a group of interested people. This web of corruption can only be destroyed with a mallet,” Prigozhin said on December 30 through a public chat that he maintains through one of his companies. That reference to the mallet was not fortuitous. The death penalty is suspended in Russia by a 1996 moratorium, but Wagner applied it without trial against a Russian citizen in November. The execution of Yevgeny Nuzhin, a former Russian prisoner who had been recruited into prison by the same company and who had subsequently been exchanged after surrendering to the Ukrainian army, was broadcast on social networks close to Wagner. The paramilitaries beat him with a mallet on his head and accused him of treason. “A dog receives the death of a dog,” Prigozhin said. “This is not our issue,” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said when asked if an investigation into the event would be opened. That was forgotten, just as it was ignored that Russian legislation punishes businessmen who recruit and train mercenaries in Russia with up to 15 years' imprisonment. “Prigozhin is not Putin’s friend, it’s just a useful tool. He knows very well by doing precisely what the Kremlin needs of him,” he says on the phone to this newspaper Mark Galeotti. The expert in Russia highlights that the businessman “hates” the Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoigú, which explains his criticism of the high command. “When Shoigú stopped the army logistics officer, he cut off his ties because that soldier granted the Prigozhin companies quite a lot of business. From his point of view, Shoigú costs him money,” he says. Unlike Putin and Shoigú, Prigozhin constantly visits the front and has no modesty in showing off alongside war mutilates or strolling through a sinister makeshift morgue in a basement. “His contracts have ended, they return home,” he commented among numerous black plastic bags where the remains of his recruits rested. For Prigozhin, this is publicity, he has found a populist niche in front of a high command that hides the drama: “Some do not like that ordinary Russians, those who do not participate in parades or have an irreproachable past, can defeat the enemy. All wars in Russia have not been won by special forces with acrobatic acts, but by those men with iron eggs.” Prigozhin's talk has no limits. A few days ago he described former President Dmitri Medvedev’s predictions for 2023 as “erotic fantasies,” and in early December he made another veiled threat against the former director of the Russian space agency Dmitri Rogozin, who had previously been criticized for wearing NATO garments. “If someone approaches Wagner’s positions in these clothes, we will return it in a plastic bag,” the businessman said. Weeks later, Rogozin was seriously injured when the Donetsk restaurant where he was was bombed. According to Russian military channels, their location could have been leaked. Prigozhin's attitude is very striking considering how the last politicians who dared to make their criticisms in public ended up. Former Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov questioned in 2010 the leadership of then President Dmitri Medvedev and was dismissed “for loss of confidence”. Two years earlier, in 2008, Víktor Cherkésov was completely removed as head of the Anti-Drug Agency. The senior officer had written in the Kommersant newspaper an article in which he criticized the internal struggles of the security services following the arrest of several of his collaborators. He never returned to politics again, and Putin publicly rebuked him: “He who makes claims about a secret service war must first be innocent.” Others, however, see Prigozhin as an upward value to approach. Kursk Governor Roman Starovoit posted a video this Sunday on Telegram announcing that he had trained the first week of the year with a Wagner unit. “Rodado of real men, patriots of Russia,” the politician said. Prigozhin recruits much of his forces among the prisoners with the promise to release them, although pardon is not the employer's power. According to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, of Wagner's 50,000 troops, only 10,000 are professional mercenaries, while the rest come from penal centers. American intelligence estimates that this private army costs the Russian Ministry of Defense about 1.2 billion euros a year, the equivalent of the budget of regions such as Briansk or Karelia. “Don’t drink too much, don’t use drugs or rape women,” Prigozhin asked in a relaxed tone several mutilated prisoners in a hospital who have recently been pardoned. In that video he also claimed the Russians' understanding of them. In parallel, independent newspapers such as Jólod and Agentstvo Novosti identified several prisoners: from a man who murdered his grandmother to collect the sale of an apartment from various thieves and drug traffickers. Prigozhin's private army is now immersed in a bloody battle for the conquest of Soledar and Bajmut. According to American espionage, behind that massacre is the attempt to keep control of mines rich in salt and plaster, as Wagner did before in Africa in exchange for his services. Another of the loose verses of Russian ultranationalism, the military Igor Girkin Strelkov, one of the most critical of the Kremlin since the beginning of the war, has charged Prigozhin for spending his forces on his business. “Even if our troops gain a tactical victory, we have strategically lost because once again they have launched our best forces for a useless goal. And in this case, the Russian armed forces will only have reached the limits of Ukraine’s third fortified line, no worse equipped than the first two,” wrote Strelkov on his personal channel, one of the Russian military who started the 2014 Donbas war. “This is not the fault of Prigozhin or Wagner, but of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, but the responsibility of these private traders must not be completely eliminated,” the military warned.
